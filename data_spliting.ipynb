They branded this technique “Deep Learning. ” Training a deep neural net\\nwas widely considered impossible at the time, 2 and most researchers had abandoned\\nthe idea since the 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community\\nand before long many new papers demonstrated that Deep Learning was not only\\npossible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other Machine Learning\\n(ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power\\nand great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of\\nMachine Learning.\\nFast-forward 10 years and Machine Learning has conquered the industry: it is now at\\nthe heart of much of the magic in today’s high-tech products, ranking your web\\nsearch results, powering your smartphone’s speech recognition, and recommending\\nvideos, beating the world champion at the game of Go.

It makes it possible to train and run very large neural net‐\\nworks efficiently by distributing the computations across potentially thousands\\nof multi-GPU servers. TensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of\\ntheir large-scale Machine Learning applications. It was open-sourced in Novem‐\\nber 2015.\\nThe book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of\\nMachine Learning through concrete working examples and just a little bit of theory.\\nWhile you can read this book without picking up your laptop, we highly recommend\\nyou experiment with the code examples available online as Jupyter notebooks at\\nhttps://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.\\nxiv | Preface\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

But Machine Learning is not\\njust a futuristic fantasy, it’s already here. In fact, it has been around for decades in\\nsome specialized applications, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). But the\\nfirst ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds\\nof millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the spam filter.\\nNot exactly a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualif\\ny as Machine Learning\\n(it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam any‐\\nmore). It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hun‐\\ndreds of products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations\\nto voice search.\\nWhere does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it\\nmean for a machine to learn something? If I download a copy of Wikipedia, has my\\ncomputer really “learned” something? Is it suddenly smarter? In this chapter we will\\nstart by clarifying what Machine Learning is and why you may want to use it.\\nThen, before we set out to explore the Machine Learning continent, we will take a\\nlook at the map and learn about the main regions and the most notable landmarks:\\nsupervised versus unsupervised learning, online versus batch learning, instance-\\nbased versus model-based learning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML\\nproject, discuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and\\nfine-tune a Machine Learning system.\\nThis chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that every data\\nscientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview (the only chapter\\nwithout much code), all rather simple, but you should make sure everything is\\ncrystal-clear to you before continuing to the rest of the book.

If you are not sure, tr\\ny to answer all\\nthe questions listed at the end of the chapter before moving on.\\nWhat Is Machine Learning?\\nMachine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can\\nlearn from data.\\nHere is a slightly more general definition:\\n[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn\\nwithout being explicitly programmed.\\n—Arthur Samuel, 1959\\nAnd a more engineering-oriented one:\\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T\\nand some performance measure P , if its performance on T, as measured by P , improves\\nwith experience E.\\n—Tom Mitchell, 1997\\nFor example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag\\nspam given examples of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular\\n(nonspam, also called “ham”) emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are\\ncalled the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample).\\nIn this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training\\ndata, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use\\nthe ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called\\naccuracy and it is often used in classification tasks.\\nIf you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is\\nnot suddenly better at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning.\\nWhy Use Machine Learning?\\nConsider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techni‐\\nques (Figure 1-1):\\n1. First you would look at what spam typically looks like. Y ou might notice that\\nsome words or phrases (such as “4U,” “\\ncredit card, ” “free, ” and “amazing”) tend to\\ncome up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns\\nin the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.\\n4 | Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The traditional approach\\nSince the problem is not trivial, your program will likely become a long list of com‐\\nplex rules—pretty hard to main\\ntain.\\nIn contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically learns\\nwhich words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually fre‐\\nquent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples\\n(Figure 1-2).

Automatically adapting to change\\nAnother area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too com‐\\nplex for traditional a\\npproaches or have no known algorithm. For example, consider \\nspeech recognition: say you want to start simple and write a program capable of dis‐\\ntinguishing the words “one” and “two. ” Y ou might notice that the word “two” starts\\nwith a high-pitch sound (“T”), so you could hardcode an algorithm that measures\\nhigh-pitch sound intensity and use that to distinguish ones and twos. Obviously this\\ntechnique will not scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of very different\\npeople in noisy environments and in dozens of languages. The best solution (at least\\ntoday) is to write an algorithm that learns by itself, given many example recordings\\nfor each word.\\nFinally, Machine Learning can help humans learn (Figure 1-4): ML algorithms can be\\ninspected to see what they have learned (although for some algorithms this can be\\ntricky). For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can\\neasily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it\\nbelieves are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected cor‐\\nrelations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.\\nApplying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns\\nthat were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.\\n6 | Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

This is called semisupervised learning\\n(Figure 1-11).\\nSome photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this.

Semisupervised learning\\nMost semisuper vised learning algorithms are combina\\ntions of unsupervised and\\nsupervised algorithms. For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsu‐\\npervised components called restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) stacked on top of\\none another. RBMs are trained sequentially in an unsupervised manner, and then the\\nwhole system is fine-tuned using supervised learning techniques.\\nReinforcement Learning\\nReinforcement Learning is a very different beast. The learning system, called an agent\\nin this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get\\nrewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards, as in Figure 1-12). It\\nmust then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most\\nreward over time.

This means that given a\\nnumber of training examples, the system needs to be able to generalize to examples it\\nhas never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training data is\\ngood, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.\\nThere are two main approaches to generalization: instance-based learning and\\nmodel-based learning.\\nInstance-based learning\\nPossibly the most trivial form of learning is simply to learn by heart. If you were to\\ncreate a spam filter this way, it would just flag all emails that are identical to emails\\nthat have already been flagged by users—not the worst solution, but certainly not the\\nbest.\\nInstead of just flagging emails that are identical to known spam emails, your spam\\nfilter could be programmed to also flag emails that are very similar to known spam\\nemails. This requires a measure of similarity between two emails. A (very basic) simi‐\\nlarity measure between two emails could be to count the number of words they have\\nin common. The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in com‐\\nmon with a known spam email.\\nThis is called instance-based learning: the system learns the examples by heart, then\\ngeneralizes to new cases using a similarity measure (Figure 1-15).\\nFigure 1-15.

All of these lists tend to favor wealthier people, who are more likely to vote\\nRepublican (hence Landon).\\n• Second, less than 25% of the people who received the poll answered. Again, this\\nintroduces a sampling bias, by ruling out people who don\\n’t care much about poli‐\\ntics, people who don’t like the Literary Digest, and other key groups. This is a spe‐\\ncial type of sampling bias called nonresponse bias.\\nHere is another example: say you want to build a system to recognize funk music vid‐\\neos. One way to build your training set is to search “funk music” on Y ouTube and use\\nthe resulting videos. But this assumes that Y ouTube’s search engine returns a set of\\nvideos that are representative of all the funk music videos on Y ouTube. In reality, the\\nsearch results are likely to be biased toward popular artists (and if you live in Brazil\\nyou will get a lot of “funk carioca” videos, which sound nothing like James Brown).\\nOn the other hand, how else can you get a large training set?\\nPoor-Quality Data\\nObviously, if your training data is full of errors, outliers, and noise (e.g., due to poor-\\nquality measurements), it will make it harder for the system to detect the underlying\\npatterns, so your system is less likely to perform well. It is often well worth the effort\\nto spend time cleaning up your training data. The truth is, most data scientists spend\\na significant part of their time doing just that. For example:\\n• If some instances are clearly outliers, it may help to simply discard them or try to\\nfix the errors manually.\\n• If some instances are missing a few fea\\ntures (e.g., 5% of your customers did not\\nspecify their age), you must decide whether you wan\\nt to ignore this attribute alto‐\\ngether, ignore these instances, fill in the missing values (e.g., with the median\\nage), or train one model with the feature and one model without it, and so on.\\nIrrelevant Features\\nAs the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out.

If\\nwe forced θ 1 = 0, the algorithm would have only one degree of freedom and would\\nhave a much harder time fitting the data properly: all it could do is move the line up\\nor down to get as close as possible to the training instances, so it would end up\\naround the mean.

One way to do that is to put your model in production and moni‐\\ntor how well it performs. This works well, but if your model is horribly bad, your\\nusers will complain—not the best idea.\\nA better option is to split your data into two sets: the training set and the test set. As\\nthese names imply, you train your model using the training set, and you test it using\\nthe test set. The error rate on new cases is called the generalization error (or out-of-\\nsample error), and by evaluating your model on the test set, you get an estimation of\\nthis error. This value tells you how well your model will perform on instances it has\\nnever seen before.\\nIf the training error is low (i.e., your model makes few mistakes on the training set)\\nbut the generalization error is high, it means that your model is overfitting the train‐\\ning data.\\nIt is common to use 80% of the data for training and hold out 20%\\nfor testing.\\nTesting and Validating | 29\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Wolperts (1996).\\nSo evaluating a model is simple enough: just use a test set. Now suppose you are hesi‐\\ntating between two models (sa y a linear model and a polynomial model): how can\\nyou decide? One option is to train both and com\\npare how well they generalize using\\nthe test set.\\nNow suppose that the linear model generalizes better, but you want to apply some \\nregularization to avoid overfitting. The question is: how do you choose the value of\\nthe regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using\\n100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparame‐\\nter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error, say just 5% error.\\nSo you launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as\\nwell as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?\\nThe problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test\\nset, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for\\nthat set. This means that the model is unlikely to perform as well on new data.\\nA common solution to this problem is to have a second holdout set called the valida‐\\ntion set. Y ou train multiple models with various hyperparameters using the training\\nset, you select the model and hyperparameters that perform best on the validation set,\\nand when you’re happy with your model you run a single final test against the test set\\nto get an estimate of the generalization error.\\nTo avoid “wasting” too much training data in validation sets, a common technique is\\nto use cross-validation: the training set is split into complementary subsets, and each\\nmodel is trained against a different combination of these subsets and validated\\nagainst the remaining parts. Once the model type and hyperparameters have been\\nselected, a final model is trained using these hyperparameters on the full training set,\\nand the generalized error is measured on the test set.\\nNo Free Lunch Theorem\\nA model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to\\ndiscard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. How‐\\never, to decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assump‐\\ntions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is\\nfundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line\\nis just noise, which can safely be ignored.\\nIn a famous 1996 paper, 11 David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely\\nno assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any\\nother. This is called the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem.

Moreover, it is also a typical regres‐\\nsion task, since you are asked to predict a value.

When you estimate the generalization error using the test\\nset, your estimate will be too optimistic and you will launch a system that will not\\nperform as well as expected.

This introduces some unfortunate sam\\npling bias.\\nBut both these solutions will break next time you fetch an updated dataset. A com‐\\nmon solution is to use each instance ’s iden\\ntifier to decide whether or not it should go\\nin the test set (assuming instances have a unique and immutable identifier). For\\nexample, you could compute a hash of each instance’s identifier, keep only the last\\nbyte of the hash, and put the instance in the test set if this value is lower or equal to\\n51 (~20% of 256). This ensures that the test set will remain consistent across multiple\\nruns, even if you refresh the dataset. The new test set will contain 20% of the new\\ninstances, but it will not contain any instance that was previously in the training set.\\nHere is a possible implementation:\\nimport hashlib\\ndef test_set_check(identifier, test_ratio, hash):\\n    return hash(np.int64(identifier)).digest()[-1] < 256 * test_ratio\\ndef split_train_test_by_id(data, test_ratio, id_column, hash=hashlib.md5):\\n    ids = data[id_column]\\n    in_test_set = ids.apply(lambda id_: test_set_check(id_, test_ratio, hash))\\n    return data.loc[~in_test_set], data.loc[in_test_set]\\nUnfortunately, the housing dataset does not have an identifier column. The simplest\\nsolution is to use the row index as the ID:\\nhousing_with_id = housing.reset_index()   # adds an `index` column\\ntrain_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, \"index\")\\nIf you use the row index as a unique identifier, you need to make sure that new data\\ngets appended to the end of the dataset, and no row ever gets deleted. If this is not\\npossible, then you can try to use the most stable features to build a unique identifier.\\nFor example, a district’s latitude and longitude are guaranteed to be stable for a few\\nmillion years, so you could combine them into an ID like so:14\\nhousing_with_id[\"id\"] = housing[\"longitude\"] * 1000 + housing[\"latitude\"]\\ntrain_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, \"id\")\\nScikit-Learn provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various\\nways. The simplest function is train_test_split, which does pretty much the same\\nthing as the function split_train_test defined earlier, with a couple of additional\\nfeatures. First there is a random_state parameter that allows you to set the random\\ngenerator seed as explained previously, and second you can pass it multiple datasets\\nwith an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices (this is\\nvery useful, for example, if you have a separate DataFrame for labels):\\n50 | Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The main design principles are:16\\n• Consistency. All objects share a consistent and simple in\\n terface:\\n— Estimators. Any object that can estima te some parameters based on a dataset\\nis called an estimator (e.g., an imputer is an estimator). The estimation itself is\\nperformed by the fit() method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or\\ntwo for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the\\nlabels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is con‐\\nsidered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer’s strategy), and it must be set\\nas an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\\n— Transformers. Some estimators (such as an imputer ) can also transform a\\ndataset; these are called transformers.

Obviously this is not the case (for\\nexample, categories 0 and 4 are more similar than categories 0 and 1). To fix this\\nissue, a common solution is to create one binary attribute per category: one attribute\\nequal to 1 when the category is “<1H OCEAN” (and 0 otherwise), another attribute\\nequal to 1 when the category is “INLAND” (and 0 otherwise), and so on. This is\\ncalled one-hot encoding, because only one attribute will be equal to 1 (hot), while the\\nothers will be 0 (cold).\\nScikit-Learn provides a OneHotEncoder encoder to convert integer categorical values\\ninto one-hot vectors. Let’s encode the categories as one-hot vectors. Note that\\nfit_transform() expects a 2D array, but housing_cat_encoded is a 1D array, so we\\nneed to reshape it:18\\n>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\\n>>> encoder = OneHotEncoder()\\n>>> housing_cat_1hot = encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat_encoded.reshape(-1,1))\\n>>> housing_cat_1hot\\n<16513x5 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'\\n with 16513 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>\\nNotice that the output is a SciPy sparse matrix, instead of a NumPy array.

After one-\\nhot encoding we get a matrix with thousands of columns, and the matrix is full of\\nzeros except for one 1 per row. Using up tons of memory mostly to store zeros would\\nbe very wasteful, so instead a sparse matrix only stores the location of the nonzero\\nelements.

The more you\\nautomate these data preparation steps, the more combinations you can automatically\\ntry out, making it much more likely that you will find a great combination (and sav‐\\ning you a lot of time).\\nFeature Scaling\\nOne of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature\\nscaling. With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don’t perform well when\\nthe input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the hous‐\\ning data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median\\nincomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the target values is generally not\\nrequired.\\nThere are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max\\nscaling and standardization.\\nMin-max scaling (many people call this normalization) is quite simple: values are\\nshifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtract‐\\ning the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a\\ntransformer called MinMaxScaler for this. It has a feature_range hyperparameter\\nthat lets you change the range if you don’t want 0–1 for some reason.\\nStandardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized\\nvalues always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the result‐\\ning distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not\\nbound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g.,\\nneural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). However, standard‐\\nization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district had a median\\nincome equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush all the other\\nvalues from 0–15 down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization would not be much affec‐\\nted. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called StandardScaler for standardization.\\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms | 65\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The names can be anything you like.\\nWhen you call the pipeline’s fit() method, it calls fit_transform() sequentially on\\nall transformers, passing the output of each call as the parameter to the next call, until\\nit reaches the final estimator, for which it just calls the fit() method.\\nThe pipeline exposes the same methods as the final estimator. In this example, the last\\nestimator is a StandardScaler, which is a transformer, so the pipeline has a trans\\nform() method that applies all the transforms to the data in sequence (it also has a\\nfit_transform method that we could have used instead of calling fit() and then\\ntransform()).\\nY ou now have a pipeline for numerical values, and you also need to apply the LabelBi\\nnarizer on the categorical values: how can you join these transformations into a sin‐\\ngle pipeline?

This model is not regularized, so this rules\\nout the last option. Y ou could tr\\ny to add more features (e.g., the log of the popula‐\\ntion), but first let’s try a more complex model to see how it does.\\nLet’s train a DecisionTreeRegressor. This is a powerful model, capable of finding\\ncomplex nonlinear relationships in the data (Decision Trees are presented in more\\ndetail in Chapter 6). The code should look familiar by now:\\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\\ntree_reg = DecisionTreeRegressor()\\ntree_reg.fit(housing_prepared, housing_labels)\\nNow that the model is trained, let’s evaluate it on the training set:\\n>>> housing_predictions = tree_reg.predict(housing_prepared)\\n>>> tree_mse = mean_squared_error(housing_labels, housing_predictions)\\n>>> tree_rmse = np.sqrt(tree_mse)\\n>>> tree_rmse\\n0.0\\nWait, what!? No error at all? Could this model really be absolutely perfect? Of course,\\nit is much more likely that the model has badly overfit the data. How can you be sure?\\nAs we saw earlier, you don’t want to touch the test set until you are ready to launch a\\nmodel you are confident about, so you need to use part of the training set for train‐\\ning, and part for model validation.\\nBetter Evaluation Using Cross-Validation\\nOne way to evaluate the Decision Tree model would be to use the train_test_split\\nfunction to split the training set into a smaller training set and a validation set, then\\ntrain your models against the smaller training set and evaluate them against the vali‐\\ndation set. It’s a bit of work, but nothing too difficult and it would work fairly well.\\nA great alternative is to use Scikit-Learn’s cross-validation feature. The following code\\nperforms K-fold cross-validation: it randomly splits the training set into 10 distinct\\nsubsets called folds, then it trains and evaluates the Decision Tree model 10 times,\\npicking a different fold for evaluation every time and training on the other 9 folds.\\nThe result is an array containing the 10 evaluation scores:\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\\nscores = cross_val_score(tree_reg, housing_prepared, housing_labels,\\n                         scoring=\"neg_mean_squared_error\", cv=10)\\nrmse_scores = np.sqrt(-scores)\\nSelect and Train a Model | 69\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

In these cases, you can implement\\ncross-validation yourself; it is actually fairly straightforward. The following code does\\nroughly the same thing as the preceding cross_val_score() code, and prints the \\nsame result:\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\\nfrom sklearn.base import clone\\nskfolds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=3, random_state=42)\\nfor train_index, test_index in skfolds.split(X_train, y_train_5):\\n    clone_clf = clone(sgd_clf)\\n    X_train_folds = X_train[train_index]\\n    y_train_folds = (y_train_5[train_index])\\n    X_test_fold = X_train[test_index]\\n    y_test_fold = (y_train_5[test_index])\\n    clone_clf.fit(X_train_folds, y_train_folds)\\n    y_pred = clone_clf.predict(X_test_fold)\\n    n_correct = sum(y_pred == y_test_fold)\\n    print(n_correct / len(y_pred))  # prints 0.9502, 0.96565 and 0.96495\\nThe StratifiedKFold class performs stratified sampling (as explained in Chapter 2)\\nto produce folds that contain a representative ratio of each class. At each iteration the\\ncode creates a clone of the classifier, trains that clone on the training folds, and makes\\npredictions on the test fold. Then it counts the number of correct predictions and\\noutputs the ratio of correct predictions.\\nLet’s use the cross_val_score() function to evaluate your SGDClassifier model\\nusing K-fold cross-validation, with three folds. Remember that K-fold cross-\\nvalidation means splitting the training set into K-folds (in this case, three), then mak‐\\ning predictions and evaluating them on each fold using a model trained on the\\nremaining folds (see Chapter 2):\\n>>> from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\\n>>> cross_val_score(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3, scoring=\"accuracy\")\\narray([ 0.9502 ,  0.96565,  0.96495])\\nPerformance Measures | 83\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Above 95% accu racy (ratio of correct predictions) on all cross-validation folds? \\nThis looks amazing, doesn’t it? Well, before you get too excited, let’s look at a very\\ndumb classifier that just classifies every single image in the “not-5” class:\\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator\\nclass Never5Classifier(BaseEstimator):\\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\\n        pass\\n    def predict(self, X):\\n        return np.zeros((len(X), 1), dtype=bool)\\nCan you guess this model’s accuracy?

This is simply because only about 10% of the\\nimages are 5s, so if you always guess that an image is not a 5, you will be right about\\n90% of the time. Beats Nostradamus.\\nThis demonstrates why accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure\\nfor classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets (i.e., when some\\nclasses are much more frequent than others).\\nConfusion Matrix\\nA much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confu‐\\nsion matrix. The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are\\nclassified as class B. For example, to know the number of times the classifier confused\\nimages of 5s with 3s, you would look in the 5 th row and 3 rd column of the confusion\\nmatrix.\\nTo compute the confusion matrix, you first need to have a set of predictions, so they\\ncan be compared to the actual targets. Y ou could make predictions on the test set, but\\nlet’s keep it untouched for now (remember that you want to use the test set only at the\\nvery end of your project, once you have a classifier that you are ready to launch).\\nInstead, you can use the cross_val_predict() function:\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict\\ny_train_pred = cross_val_predict(sgd_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3)\\nJust like the cross_val_score() function, cross_val_predict() performs K-fold\\ncross-validation, but instead of returning the evaluation scores, it returns the predic‐\\ntions made on each test fold. This means that you get a clean prediction for each\\ninstance in the training set (“clean” meaning that the prediction is made by a model\\nthat never saw the data during training).\\n84 | Chapter 3: Classification\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

This is not always\\nwhat you want: in some contexts you mostly care about precision, and in other con‐\\ntexts you really care about recall. For example, if you trained a classifier to detect vid‐\\neos that are safe for kids, you would probably prefer a classifier that rejects many\\ngood videos (low recall) but keeps only safe ones (high precision), rather than a clas‐\\nsifier that has a much higher recall but lets a few really bad videos show up in your\\nproduct (in such cases, you may even want to add a human pipeline to check the clas‐\\nsifier’s video selection). On the other hand, suppose you train a classifier to detect\\nshoplifters on surveillance images: it is probably fine if your classifier has only 30%\\nprecision as long as it has 99% recall (sure, the security guards will get a few false\\nalerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught).\\nUnfortunately, you can’t have it both ways: increasing precision reduces recall, and\\nvice versa. This is called the precision/recall tradeoff.\\nPrecision/Recall Tradeoff\\nTo understand this tradeoff, let’s look at how the SGDClassifier makes its classifica‐\\ntion decisions. F or each instance, it com putes a score based on a \\ndecision function, \\nand if that score is greater than a threshold, it assigns the instance to the positive\\nclass, or else it assigns it to the negative class. Figure 3-3 shows a few digits positioned\\nfrom the lowest score on the left to the highest score on the right. Suppose the deci‐\\nsion threshold is positioned at the central arrow (between the two 5s): you will find 4\\ntrue positives (actual 5s) on the right of that threshold, and one false positive (actually\\na 6). Therefore, with that threshold, the precision is 80% (4 out of 5). But out of 6\\nactual 5s, the classifier only detects 4, so the recall is 67% (4 out of 6). Now if you\\nraise the threshold (move it to the arrow on the right), the false positive (the 6)\\nbecomes a true negative, thereby increasing precision (up to 100% in this case), but\\none true positive becomes a false negative, decreasing recall down to 50%. Conversely,\\nlowering the threshold increases recall and reduces precision.\\nPerformance Measures | 87\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The dotted line represen ts the RO C cur\\nve of a purely\\nrandom classifier; a good classifier stays as far away from that line as possible (toward\\nthe top-left corner).\\nOne way to compare classifiers is to measure the area under the curve (AUC). A per‐\\nfect classifier will have a ROC AUC equal to 1, whereas a purely random classifier will\\nhave a ROC AUC equal to 0.5. Scikit-Learn provides a function to compute the ROC\\nAUC:\\n>>> from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\\n>>> roc_auc_score(y_train_5, y_scores)\\n0.97061072797174941\\nSince the ROC curve is so similar to the precision/recall (or PR)\\ncurve, you may wonder how to decide which one to use. As a rule\\nof thumb, you should prefer the PR curve whenever the positive\\nclass is rare or when you care more about the false positives than\\nthe false negatives, and the ROC curve otherwise. For example,\\nlooking at the previous ROC curve (and the ROC AUC score), you\\nmay think that the classifier is really good. But this is mostly\\nbecause there are few positives (5s) compared to the negatives\\n(non-5s). In contrast, the PR curve makes it clear that the classifier\\nhas room for improvement (the curve could be closer to the top-\\nright corner).\\nLet’s train a RandomForestClassifier and compare its ROC curve and ROC AUC\\nscore to the SGDClassifier. First, you need to get scores for each instance in the\\ntraining set. But due to the way it works (see Chapter 7), the RandomForestClassi\\nfier class does not have a decision_function() method. Instead it has a pre\\ndict_proba() method. Scikit-Learn classifiers generally have one or the other. The\\npredict_proba() method returns an array containing a row per instance and a col‐\\numn per class, each containing the probability that the given instance belongs to the\\ngiven class (e.g., 70% chance that the image represents a 5):\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\\nforest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)\\ny_probas_forest = cross_val_predict(forest_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3,\\n                                    method=\"predict_proba\")\\nBut to plot a ROC curve, you need scores, not probabilities.

Others (such as Support Vector Machine\\nclassifiers or Linear classifiers) are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are vari‐\\nous strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification using multiple\\nbinary classifiers.\\nFor example, one way to create a system that can classify the digit images into 10\\nclasses (from 0 to 9) is to train 10 binary classifiers, one for each digit (a 0-detector, a\\n1-detector, a 2-detector, and so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get\\nthe decision score from each classifier for that image and you select the class whose\\nclassifier outputs the highest score. This is called the one-versus-all (OvA) strategy \\n(also called one-versus-the-rest).\\nAnother strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distin‐\\nguish 0s and 1s, another to distinguish 0s and 2s, another for 1s and 2s, and so on.\\nThis is called the one-versus-one (OvO) strategy. If there are N classes, you need to\\ntrain N × (N – 1) / 2 classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training 45\\nbinary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image\\nthrough all 45 classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The main advan‐\\ntage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training\\nset for the two classes that it must distinguish.\\nSome algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine classifiers) scale poorly with the\\nsize of the training set, so for these algorithms OvO is preferred since it is faster to\\ntrain many classifiers on small training sets than training few classifiers on large\\ntraining sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvA is preferred.\\nScikit-Learn detects when you try to use a binary classification algorithm for a multi‐\\nclass classification task, and it automatically runs OvA (except for SVM classifiers for\\nwhich it uses OvO). Let’s try this with the SGDClassifier:\\n>>> sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y_train, not y_train_5\\n>>> sgd_clf.predict([some_digit])\\narray([ 5.])\\nThat was easy! This code trains the SGDClassifier on the training set using the origi‐\\nnal target classes from 0 to 9 (y_train), instead of the 5-versus-all target classes\\n(y_train_5). Then it makes a prediction (a correct one in this case). Under the hood,\\nScikit-Learn actually trained 10 binary classifiers, got their decision scores for the\\nimage, and selected the class with the highest score.\\nTo see that this is indeed the case, you can call the decision_function() method.\\nInstead of returning just one score per instance, it now returns 10 scores, one per\\nclass:\\n>>> some_digit_scores = sgd_clf.decision_function([some_digit])\\n>>> some_digit_scores\\n94 | Chapter 3: Classification\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

First, you need to divide each value in the confusion\\nmatrix by the number of images in the corresponding class, so you can compare error\\nrates instead of absolute number of errors (which would make abundant classes look\\nunfairly bad):\\nrow_sums = conf_mx.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\\nnorm_conf_mx = conf_mx / row_sums\\nNow let’s fill the diagonal with zeros to keep only the errors, and let’s plot the result:\\nnp.fill_diagonal(norm_conf_mx, 0)\\nplt.matshow(norm_conf_mx, cmap=plt.cm.gray)\\nplt.show()\\nError Analysis | 97\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Remember that rows\\nrepresent actual classes, while columns represent predicted classes. The columns for\\nclasses 8 and 9 are quite brigh\\nt, which tells you that many images get misclassified as\\n8s or 9s. Similarly, the rows for classes 8 and 9 are also quite bright, telling you that 8s\\nand 9s are often confused with other digits. Conversely, some rows are pretty dark,\\nsuch as row 1: this means that most 1s are classified correctly (a few are confused\\nwith 8s, but that’s about it). Notice that the errors are not perfectly symmetrical; for\\nexample, there are more 5s misclassified as 8s than the reverse.\\nAnalyzing the confusion matrix can often give you insights on ways to improve your\\nclassifier. Looking at this plot, it seems that your efforts should be spent on improving\\nclassification of 8s and 9s, as well as fixing the specific 3/5 confusion. For example,\\nyou could try to gather more training data for these digits. Or you could engineer\\nnew features that would help the classifier—for example, writing an algorithm to\\ncount the number of closed loops (e.g., 8 has two, 6 has one, 5 has none).

In some cases you\\nmay wan\\nt your classifier to output multiple classes for each instance. For example,\\nconsider a face-recognition classifier: what should it do if it recognizes several people\\non the same picture? Of course it should attach one label per person it recognizes. Say\\nthe classifier has been trained to recognize three faces, Alice, Bob, and Charlie; then\\nwhen it is shown a picture of Alice and Charlie, it should output [1, 0, 1] (meaning\\n“ Alice yes, Bob no, Charlie yes”). Such a classification system that outputs multiple\\nbinary labels is called a multilabel classification system.\\nWe won’\\nt go into face recognition just yet, but let’s look at a simpler example, just for\\nillustration purposes:\\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\\ny_train_large = (y_train >= 7)\\ny_train_odd = (y_train % 2 == 1)\\ny_multilabel = np.c_[y_train_large, y_train_odd]\\nknn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier()\\nknn_clf.fit(X_train, y_multilabel)\\nThis code creates a y_multilabel array containing two target labels for each digit\\nimage: the first indicates whether or not the digit is large (7, 8, or 9) and the second\\nindicates whether or not it is odd. The next lines create a KNeighborsClassifier \\ninstance (which supports multilabel classification, but not all classifiers do) and we\\ntrain it using the multiple targets array. Now you can make a prediction, and notice\\nthat it outputs two labels:\\n>>> knn_clf.predict([some_digit])\\narray([[False,  True]], dtype=bool)\\nAnd it gets it right! The digit 5 is indeed not large (False) and odd (True).\\nThere are many ways to evaluate a multilabel classifier, and selecting the right metric\\nreally depends on your project. For example, one approach is to measure the F 1 score\\nfor each individual label (or any other binary classifier metric discussed earlier), then\\nsimply compute the average score. This code computes the average F 1 score across all\\nlabels:\\n>>> y_train_knn_pred = cross_val_predict(knn_clf, X_train, y_train, cv=3)\\n>>> f1_score(y_train, y_train_knn_pred, average=\"macro\")\\n0.96845540180280221\\nThis assumes that all labels are equally important, which may not be the case. In par‐\\nticular, if you have many more pictures of Alice than of Bob or Charlie, you may want\\nto give more weight to the classifier’s score on pictures of Alice.

To do this, simply set average=\"weighted\" in the preceding code.4\\nMultioutput Classification\\nThe last type of classification task we are going to discuss here is called m ul tioutput-\\nmulticlass classification (or simply mu ltioutput classification). It is simply a generaliza‐\\ntion of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass (i.e., it can have\\nmore than two possible values).\\nTo illustrate this, let’s build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as\\ninput a noisy digit image, and it will (hopefully) output a clean digit image, repre‐\\nsented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images. Notice that the\\nclassifier’s output is multilabel (one label per pixel) and each label can have multiple\\nvalues (pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255). It is thus an example of a multioutput\\nclassification system.\\nThe line between classification and regression is sometimes blurry,\\nsuch as in this example. Arguably, predicting pixel intensity is more\\nakin to regression than to classification. Moreover, multioutput\\nsystems are not limited to classification tasks; you could even have\\na system that outputs multiple labels per instance, including both\\nclass labels and value labels.\\nLet’s start by creating the training and test sets by taking the MNIST images and\\nadding noise to their pixel intensities using NumPy’s randint() function. The target\\nimages will be the original images:\\nnoise = rnd.randint(0, 100, (len(X_train), 784))\\nnoise = rnd.randint(0, 100, (len(X_test), 784))\\nX_train_mod = X_train + noise\\nX_test_mod = X_test + noise\\ny_train_mod = X_train\\ny_test_mod = X_test\\nLet’s take a peek at an image from the test set (yes, we’re snooping on the test data, so\\nyou should be frowning right now):\\nMultioutput Classification | 101\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

In the middle, the learning rate looks pretty good: in\\njust a few iterations, it has already converged to the solution. On the right, the learn‐\\ning rate is too high: the algorithm diverges, jumping all over the place and actually\\ngetting further and further away from the solution at every step.\\nTo find a good learning rate, you can use grid search (see Chapter 2). However, you\\nmay want to limit the number of iterations so that grid search can eliminate models\\nthat take too long to converge.\\nY ou may wonder how to set the number of iterations. If it is too low, you will still be\\nfar away from the optimal solution when the algorithm stops, but if it is too high, you\\nwill waste time while the model parameters do not change anymore. A simple solu‐\\ntion is to set a very large number of iterations but to interrupt the algorithm when the\\ngradient vector becomes tiny—that is, when its norm becomes smaller than a tiny\\nnumber \\nϵ (called the tolerance)—because this happens when Gradient Descent has\\n(almost) reached the minimum.\\n116 | Chapter 4: Training Models\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

In other words, if you divide\\nthe tolerance ϵ by 10 (to have a more precise solution), then the algorithm will have\\nto run about 10 times more iterations.\\nStochastic Gradient Descent\\nThe main problem with Batch Gradient Descent is the fact that it uses the whole\\ntraining set to compute the gradients at every step, which makes it very slow when\\nthe training set is large. At the opposite extreme, Stochastic Gradient Descent just\\npicks a random instance in the training set at every step and computes the gradients\\nbased only on that single instance. Obviously this makes the algorithm much faster\\nsince it has very little data to manipulate at every iteration. It also makes it possible to\\ntrain on huge training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each\\niteration (SGD can be implemented as an out-of-core algorithm.7)\\nOn the other hand, due to its stochastic (i.e., random) nature, this algorithm is much\\nless regular than Batch Gradient Descent: instead of gently decreasing until it reaches\\nthe minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on aver‐\\nage. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will\\ncontinue to bounce around, never settling down (see Figure 4-9).

First, let’s look at the performance on the training\\ndata: when there are just one or two instances in the training set, the model can fit\\nthem perfectly, which is wh\\ny the curve starts at zero. But as new instances are added\\nto the training set, it becomes impossible for the model to fit the training data per‐\\nfectly, both because the data is noisy and because it is not linear at all. So the error on\\nthe training data goes up until it reaches a plateau, at which point adding new instan‐\\nces to the training set doesn’t make the average error much better or worse. Now let’s\\nlook at the performance of the model on the validation data. When the model is\\ntrained on very few training instances, it is incapable of generalizing properly, which\\nis why the validation error is initially quite big. Then as the model is shown more\\ntraining examples, it learns and thus the validation error slowly goes down. However,\\nonce again a straight line cannot do a good job modeling the data, so the error ends\\nup at a plateau, very close to the other curve.\\nThese learning curves are typical of an underfitting model. Both curves have reached\\na plateau; they are close and fairly high.\\nIf your model is underfitting the training data, adding more train‐\\ning examples will not help. Y ou need to use a more complex model\\nor come up with better features.\\nNow let’s look at the learning curves of a 10 th-degree polynomial model on the same\\ndata (Figure 4-16):\\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\\npolynomial_regression = Pipeline((\\n        (\"poly_features\", PolynomialFeatures(degree=10, include_bias=False)),\\n        (\"sgd_reg\", LinearRegression()),\\n    ))\\nplot_learning_curves(polynomial_regression, X, y)\\nThese learning curves look a bit like the previous ones, but there are two very impor‐\\ntant differences:\\n• The error on the training data is much lower than with the Linear Regression\\nmodel.\\n• There is a gap between the curves. This means that the model performs signifi‐\\ncantly better on the training da ta than on the valida\\ntion data, which is the hall‐\\nmark of an overfitting model. However, if you used a much larger training set,\\nthe two curves would continue to get closer.\\nLearning Curves | 125\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The only way to reduce this\\npart of the error is to clean up the da\\nta (e.g., fix the data sources, such as broken\\nsensors, or detect and remove outliers).\\nIncreasing a model’s complexity will typically increase its variance and reduce its bias.\\nConversely, reducing a model’s complexity increases its bias and reduces its variance. \\nThis is why it is called a tradeoff.\\nRegularized Linear Models\\nAs we saw in Chapters 1 and 2, a good way to reduce overfitting is to regularize the\\nmodel (i.e., to constrain it): the fewer degrees of freedom it has, the harder it will be\\nfor it to overfit the data. For example, a simple way to regularize a polynomial model\\nis to reduce the number of polynomial degrees.\\nFor a linear model, regularization is typically achieved by constraining the weights of\\nthe model. We will now look at Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net,\\nwhich implement three different ways to constrain the weights.\\nRidge Regression\\nRidge Regression (also called Tikhonov regularization) is a regularized version of Lin‐\\near Regression: a regularization term equal to α ∑i = 1\\nn θi\\n2 is added to the cost function. \\nThis forces the learning algorithm to not only fit the da ta but also keep the model\\nweights as small as possible. N\\note that the regularization term should only be added\\nto the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, you want to evaluate\\nthe model’s performance using the unregularized performance measure.\\nIt is quite common for the cost function used during training to be\\ndifferent from the performance measure used for testing. Apart\\nfrom regularization, another reason why they might be different is\\nthat a good training cost function should have optimization-\\nfriendly derivatives, while the performance measure used for test‐\\ning should be as close as possible to the final objective. A good\\nexample of this is a classifier trained using a cost function such as\\nthe log loss (discussed in a moment) but evaluated using precision/\\nrecall.\\nThe hyperparameter α controls how much you want to regularize the model.

Logistic Regression (also called Logit Regression) is com‐\\nmonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class\\n(e.g., what is the probability that this email is spam?). If the estimated probability is\\ngreater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class\\n(called the positive class, labeled “1”), or else it predicts that it does not (i.e., it\\nbelongs to the negative class, labeled “0”). This makes it a binary classifier.\\nEstimating Probabilities\\nSo how does it work? Just like a Linear Regression model, a Logistic Regression\\nmodel computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term), but instead\\nof outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression model does, it outputs the\\nlogistic of this result (see Equation 4-13).\\nEquation 4-13. Logistic Regression model estimated probability (vectorized form)\\np = hθ \\ud835 = σ θT · \\ud835\\nThe logistic—also called the log i t, noted σ(·)—is a sigmoid function (i.e., S-shaped)\\nthat outputs a number between 0 and 1.

Suppose you want to efficiently\\ntransmit information about the weather every day. If there are eight options (sunny,\\nrainy, etc.), you could encode each option using 3 bits since 2 3 = 8. However, if you\\nthink it will be sunny almost every day, it would be much more efficient to code\\n“sunny” on just one bit (0) and the other seven options on 4 bits (starting with a 1).\\nCross entropy measures the average number of bits you actually send per option. If\\nyour assumption about the weather is perfect, cross entropy will just be equal to the\\nentropy of the weather itself (i.e., its intrinsic unpredictability). But if your assump‐\\ntions are wrong (e.g., if it rains often), cross entropy will be greater by an amount \\ncalled the Kullback–Leibler divergence.\\nThe cross entropy between two probability distributions p and q is defined as\\nH\\np, q = − ∑ x p x log q x  (at least when the distributions are discrete).\\nThe gradient vector of this cost function with regards to θk is given by \\nEquation 4-23:\\nEquation 4-23.

It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and any‐\\none interested in Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are partic‐\\nularly well suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.\\nThis chapter will explain the core concepts of SVMs, how to use them, and how they\\nwork.\\nLinear SVM Classification\\nThe fundamental idea behind SVMs is best explained with some pictures. Figure 5-1\\nshows part of the iris dataset tha t was in\\ntroduced at the end of Chapter 4. The two\\nclasses can clearly be separated easily with a straight line (they are linearly separable).\\nThe left plot shows the decision boundaries of three possible linear classifiers. The\\nmodel whose decision boundary is represented by the dashed line is so bad that it\\ndoes not even separate the classes properly. The other two models work perfectly on\\nthis training set, but their decision boundaries come so close to the instances that\\nthese models will probably not perform as well on new instances. In contrast, the\\nsolid line in the plot on the right represents the decision boundary of an SVM classi‐\\nfier; this line not only separates the two classes but also stays as far away from the\\nclosest training instances as possible. Y ou can think of an SVM classifier as fitting the\\nwidest possible street (represented by the parallel dashed lines) between the classes.\\nThis is called large margin classification.\\n145\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Having a good sense of what each hyperparameter actually\\ndoes can also help you search in the right part of the hyperparame‐\\nter space.\\nAdding Similarity Features\\nAnother technique to tackle nonlinear problems is to add features computed using a\\nsimilarity function that measures how much each instance resembles a particular\\nlandmark. For example, let’s take the one-dimensional dataset discussed earlier and\\nadd two landmarks to it at x 1 = –2 and x 1 = 1 (see the left plot in Figure 5-8). Next,\\nlet’s define the similarity function to be the Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF)\\nwith γ = 0.3 (see Equation 5-1).\\nEquation 5-1. Gaussian RBF\\nϕγ\\n\\ud835, ℓ = exp −γ∥ \\ud835− ℓ ∥2\\nIt is a bell-shaped function varying from 0 (very far away from the landmark) to 1 (at\\nthe landmark). Now we are ready to compute the new fea\\ntures. For example, let’s look\\nat the instance x 1 = –1: it is located at a distance of 1 from the first landmark, and 2\\nfrom the second landmark. Therefore its new features are x 2 = exp (–0.3 × 1 2) ≈ 0.74\\nand x3 = exp (–0.3 × 2 2) ≈ 0.30. The plot on the right of Figure 5-8 shows the trans‐\\nformed dataset (dropping the original features). As you can see, it is now linearly\\nseparable.\\nNonlinear SVM Classification | 151\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The downside is that a training set with m instances and n features\\ngets transformed into a training set with m instances and m features (assuming you\\ndrop the original features). If your training set is very large, you end up with an\\nequally large number of features.\\nGaussian RBF Kernel\\nJust like the polynomial features method, the similarity features method can be useful\\nwith any Machine Learning algorithm, but it may be computationally expensive to\\ncompute all the additional features, especially on large training sets. However, once\\nagain the kernel trick does its SVM magic: it makes it possible to obtain a similar\\nresult as if you had added many similarity features, without actually having to add\\nthem. Let’s try the Gaussian RBF kernel using the SVC class:\\nrbf_kernel_svm_clf = Pipeline((\\n        (\"scaler\", StandardScaler()),\\n        (\"svm_clf\", SVC(kernel=\"rbf\", gamma=5, C=0.001))\\n    ))\\nrbf_kernel_svm_clf.fit(X, y)\\nThis model is represented on the bottom left of Figure 5-9. The other plots show\\nmodels trained with different values of hyperparameters gamma (γ) and C. Increasing\\ngamma makes the bell-shape curve narrower (see the left plot of Figure 5-8), and as a\\nresult each instance’s range of influence is smaller: the decision boundary ends up\\nbeing more irregular, wiggling around individual instances. Conversely, a small gamma \\nvalue makes the bell-shaped curve wider, so instances have a larger range of influ‐\\nence, and the decision boundary ends up smoother. So γ acts like a regularization\\nhyperparameter: if your model is overfitting, you should reduce it, and if it is under‐\\nfitting, you should increase it (similar to the C hyperparameter).\\n152 | Chapter 5: Support Vector Machines\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Suppose you find\\nan iris flower and you want to classify it. Y ou start at the root node (depth 0, at the\\ntop): this node asks whether the flower’s petal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If it is,\\nthen you move down to the root’s left child node (depth 1, left). In this case, it is a leaf\\nnode (i.e., it does not have any children nodes), so it does not ask any questions: you\\ncan simply look at the predicted class for that node and the Decision Tree predicts\\nthat your flower is an Iris-Setosa (class=setosa).\\nNow suppose you find another flower, but this time the petal length is greater than\\n2.45 cm. Y ou must move down to the root’s right child node (depth 1, right), which is\\nnot a leaf node, so it asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm? If\\nit is, then your flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor (depth 2, left). If not, it is likely\\nan Iris-Virginica (depth 2, right). It’s really that simple.\\nOne of the many qualities of Decision Trees is that they require\\nvery little data preparation. In particular, they don’t require feature\\nscaling or centering at all.\\nA node’s samples attribute counts how many training instances it applies to. For\\nexample, 100 training instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm (depth 1,\\nright), among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm (depth 2, left). A\\nnode’s value attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node\\napplies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris-\\nVersicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. Finally, a node’s gini attribute measures its impur‐\\nity: a node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same\\nclass. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training\\ninstances, it is pure and its gini score is 0. Equation 6-1 shows how the training algo‐\\nrithm computes the gini score G i of the i th node. For example, the depth-2 left node\\nhas a gini score equal to 1 – (0/54) 2 – (49/54) 2 – (5/54) 2 ≈ 0.168. Another impurity\\nmeasure is discussed shortly.\\nEquation 6-1.

They\\nmake great predictions, and you can easily check the calculations that they performed\\nto make these predictions; nevertheless, it is usually hard to explain in simple terms\\nwhy the predictions were made. For example, if a neural network says that a particu‐\\nlar person appears on a picture, it is hard to know what actually contributed to this\\nprediction: did the model recognize that person’s eyes? Her mouth? Her nose? Her\\nshoes? Or even the couch that she was sitting on?

If left\\nunconstrained, the tree structure will adapt itself to the training data, fitting it very\\nclosely, and most likely overfitting it. Such a model is often called a nonparametric\\nmodel, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the\\nnumber of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is\\nfree to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model such as a linear model\\nhas a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited,\\nreducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting).\\nTo avoid overfitting the training data, you need to restrict the Decision Tree’s freedom\\nduring training. As you know by now, this is called regularization. The regularization\\nhyperparameters depend on the algorithm used, but generally you can at least restrict\\nthe maximum depth of the Decision Tree. In Scikit-Learn, this is controlled by the\\nmax_depth hyperparameter (the default value is None, which means unlimited).\\nReducing max_depth will regularize the model and thus reduce the risk of overfitting.\\nThe DecisionTreeClassifier class has a few other parameters that similarly restrict\\nthe shape of the Decision Tree: min_samples_split (the minimum number of sam‐\\nRegularization Hyperparameters | 173\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

First, as you may have noticed, Decision\\nTrees love orthogonal decision boundaries (all splits are perpendicular to an axis),\\nwhich makes them sensitive to training set rotation. For example, Figure 6-7 shows a\\nsimple linearly separable dataset: on the left, a Decision Tree can split it easily, while\\non the right, after the dataset is rotated by 45°, the decision boundary looks unneces‐\\nsarily convoluted. Although both Decision Trees fit the training set perfectly, it is very\\nlikely that the model on the right will not generalize well. One way to limit this prob‐\\nlem is to use PCA (see Chapter 8), which often results in a better orientation of the\\ntraining data.\\nFigure 6-7. Sensitivity to training set rotation\\nMore generally, the main issue with Decision T\\nrees is that they are very sensitive to\\nsmall variations in the training data. For example, if you just remove the widest Iris-\\nVersicolor from the iris training set (the one with petals 4.8 cm long and 1.8 cm wide)\\nand train a new Decision Tree, you may get the model represented in Figure 6-8. As\\nyou can see, it looks very different from the previous Decision Tree (Figure 6-2).\\nActually, since the training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn is stochastic 6 you may\\nget very different models even on the same training data (unless you set the\\nrandom_state hyperparameter).\\nInstability | 177\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Similarly, if you aggregate\\nthe predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will\\noften get better predictions than with the best individual predictor. A group of pre‐\\ndictors is called an ensemble; thus, this technique is called Ensemble Learning, and an\\nEnsemble Learning algorithm is called an Ensemble method.\\nFor example, you can train a group of Decision Tree classifiers, each on a different\\nrandom subset of the training set. To make predictions, you just obtain the predic‐\\ntions of all individual trees, then predict the class that gets the most votes (see the last\\nexercise in Chapter 6). Such an ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest, \\nand despite its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful Machine Learning algo‐\\nrithms available today.\\nMoreover, as we discussed in Chapter 2, you will often use Ensemble methods near\\nthe end of a project, once you have already built a few good predictors, to combine\\nthem into an even better predictor. In fact, the winning solutions in Machine Learn‐\\ning competitions often involve several Ensemble methods (most famously in the Net‐\\nflix Prize competition).\\nIn this chapter we will discuss the most popular Ensemble methods, including bag‐\\nging, boosting, stacking, and a few others.

The more you toss the coin, the higher the probability (e.g.,\\nwith 10,000 tosses, the probability climbs over 97%). This is due to the law of large\\nnumbers: as you keep tossing the coin, the ratio of heads gets closer and closer to the\\nprobability of heads (51%). Figure 7-3 shows 10 series of biased coin tosses. Y ou can\\nsee that as the number of tosses increases, the ratio of heads approaches 51%.

Zhu et al. (2006).\\n17 First introduced in “ Arcing the Edge, ” L. Breiman (1997).\\nScikit-Learn actually uses a multiclass version of AdaBoost called SAMME 16 (which\\nstands for S ta\\ngewise Additive Modeling using a Multiclass Exponential loss function).\\nWhen there are just two classes, SAMME is equivalent to AdaBoost. Moreover, if the\\npredictors can estimate class probabilities (i.e., if they have a predict_proba()\\nmethod), Scikit-Learn can use a variant of SAMME called SAMME.R (the R stands\\nfor “Real”), which relies on class probabilities rather than predictions and generally\\nperforms better.\\nThe following code trains an AdaBoost classifier based on 200 Decision Stumps using\\nScikit-Learn’s AdaBoostClassifier class (as you might expect, there is also an Ada\\nBoostRegressor class). A Decision Stump is a Decision Tree with max_depth=1—in\\nother words, a tree composed of a single decision node plus two leaf nodes. This is\\nthe default base estimator for the AdaBoostClassifier class:\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\\nada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(\\n        DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1), n_estimators=200,\\n        algorithm=\"SAMME.R\", learning_rate=0.5\\n    )\\nada_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\\nIf your AdaBoost ensemble is overfitting the training set, you can\\ntry reducing the number of estimators or more strongly regulariz‐\\ning the base estimator.\\nGradient Boosting\\nAnother very popular Boosting algorithm is Gradient Boosting. 17 Just like AdaBoost,\\nGradient Boosting works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one\\ncorrecting its predecessor. However, instead of tweaking the instance weights at every\\niteration like AdaBoost does, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual\\nerrors made by the previous predictor.\\nLet’s go through a simple regression example using Decision Trees as the base predic‐\\ntors (of course Gradient Boosting also works great with regression tasks). This is\\ncalled Gradient Tree Boosting, or Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT). First, let’s\\nfit a DecisionTreeRegressor to the training set (for example, a noisy quadratic train‐\\ning set):\\nBoosting | 195\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Moreover, two neighboring pixels\\nare often highly correlated: if you merge them into a single pixel (e.g., by taking the\\nmean of the two pixel intensities), you will not lose much information.\\nReducing dimensionality does lose some information (just like\\ncompressing an image to JPEG can degrade its quality), so even\\nthough it will speed up training, it may also make your system per‐\\nform slightly worse. It also makes your pipelines a bit more com‐\\nplex and thus harder to maintain.

This is quite counterintuitive: how can two points be so far apart\\nwhen they both lie within the same unit h ypercube? This fact im\\nplies that high-\\ndimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse: most training instances are\\nlikely to be far away from each other. Of course, this also means that a new instance\\nwill likely be far away from any training instance, making predictions much less relia‐\\nble than in lower dimensions, since they will be based on much larger extrapolations.\\nIn short, the more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting\\nit.\\nIn theory, one solution to the curse of dimensionality could be to increase the size of\\nthe training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. Unfortunately, in\\npractice, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows\\nexponentially with the number of dimensions.

Put simply, a 2D manifold is a 2D\\nshape that can be bent and twisted in a higher-dimensional space. More generally, a\\nd-dimensional manifold is a part of an n-dimensional space (where d < n) that locally\\nresembles a d-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of the Swiss roll, d = 2 and n = 3: it\\nlocally resembles a 2D plane, but it is rolled in the third dimension.\\nMany dimensionality reduction algorithms work by modeling the manifold on which\\nthe training instances lie; this is called Manifold Learning. It relies on the manifold\\nassumption, also called the manifold hypothesis, which holds that most real-world\\nhigh-dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower-dimensional manifold. This\\nassumption is very often empirically observed.\\nOnce again, think about the MNIST dataset: all handwritten digit images have some\\nsimilarities. They are made of connected lines, the borders are white, they are more\\nor less centered, and so on. If you randomly generated images, only a ridiculously\\ntiny fraction of them would look like handwritten digits. In other words, the degrees\\nof freedom available to you if you try to create a digit image are dramatically lower\\nthan the degrees of freedom you would have if you were allowed to generate any\\nimage you wanted. These constraints tend to squeeze the dataset into a lower-\\ndimensional manifold.\\nThe manifold assumption is often accompanied by another implicit assumption: that\\nthe task at hand (e.g., classification or regression) will be simpler if expressed in the\\nlower-dimensional space of the manifold. For example, in the top row of Figure 8-6\\nthe Swiss roll is split into two classes: in the 3D space (on the left), the decision\\nboundary would be fairly complex, but in the 2D unrolled manifold space (on the\\nright), the decision boundary is a simple straight line.\\nHowever, this assumption does not always hold. For example, in the bottom row of\\nFigure 8-6, the decision boundary is located at x 1 = 5. This decision boundary looks\\nvery simple in the original 3D space (a vertical plane), but it looks more complex in\\nthe unrolled manifold (a collection of four independent line segments).\\nIn short, if you reduce the dimensionality of your training set before training a\\nmodel, it will definitely speed up training, but it may not always lead to a better or\\nsimpler solution; it all depends on the dataset.\\nHopefully you now have a good sense of what the curse of dimensionality is and how\\ndimensionality reduction algorithms can fight it, especially when the manifold\\nassumption holds.

Thanks to the kernel trick, this is mathematically equivalent to\\nmapping the training set to an infinite-dimensional feature space (bottom right)\\nusing the feature map φ, then projecting the transformed training set down to 2D\\nusing linear PCA. Notice that if we could invert the linear PCA step for a given\\ninstance in the reduced space, the reconstructed point would lie in feature space, not\\nin the original space (e.g., like the one represented by an x in the diagram). Since the\\nfeature space is infinite-dimensional, we cannot compute the reconstructed point,\\nand therefore we cannot compute the true reconstruction error. Fortunately, it is pos‐\\nsible to find a point in the original space that would map close to the reconstructed\\npoint. This is called the reconstruction pre-image. Once you have this pre-image, you\\ncan measure its squared distance to the original instance. Y ou can then select the ker‐\\nnel and hyperparameters that minimize this reconstruction pre-image error.\\nFigure 8-11.

It is a Manifold Learning technique that does not rely\\non projections like the previous algorithms. In a nutshell, LLE works by first measur‐\\ning how each training instance linearly relates to its closest neighbors (c.n.), and then\\nlooking for a low-dimensional representation of the training set where these local\\nrelationships are best preserved (more details shortly). This makes it particularly\\ngood at unrolling twisted manifolds, especially when there is not too much noise.\\nFor example, the following code uses Scikit-Learn’s LocallyLinearEmbedding class to\\nunroll the Swiss roll. The resulting 2D dataset is shown in Figure 8-12. As you can\\nsee, the Swiss roll is completely unrolled and the distances between instances are\\nlocally well preserved. However, distances are not preserved on a larger scale: the left\\npart of the unrolled Swiss roll is squeezed, while the right part is stretched. Neverthe‐\\nless, LLE did a pretty good job at modeling the manifold.\\nLLE | 221\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The most important thing to understand is that this code does\\nnot actually perform any computa\\ntion, even though it looks like it does (especially the\\nlast line). It just creates a computation graph. In fact, even the variables are not ini‐\\ntialized yet. To evaluate this graph, you need to open a TensorFlow session and use it\\nto initialize the variables and evaluate f. A TensorFlow session takes care of placing\\nthe operations onto devices such as CPUs and GPUs and running them, and it holds\\nall the variable values. 3 The following code creates a session, initializes the variables,\\nand evaluates, and f then closes the session (which frees up resources):\\n>>> sess = tf.Session()\\n>>> sess.run(x.initializer)\\n>>> sess.run(y.initializer)\\n>>> result = sess.run(f)\\n>>> print(result)\\n42\\n>>> sess.close()\\nHaving to repeat sess.run() all the time is a bit cumbersome, but fortunately there is\\na better way:\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    x.initializer.run()\\n    y.initializer.run()\\n    result = f.eval()\\nInside the with block, the session is set as the default session. Calling x.initial\\nizer.run() is equivalent to calling tf.get_default_session().run(x.initial\\nizer), and similarly f.eval() is equivalent to calling\\ntf.get_default_session().run(f). This makes the code easier to read. Moreover,\\nthe session is automatically closed at the end of the block.\\nInstead of manually running the initializer for every single variable, you can use the\\nglobal_variables_initializer() function. Note that it does not actually perform\\nthe initialization immediately, but rather creates a node in the graph that will initialize\\nall variables when it is run:\\ninit = tf.global_variables_initializer()  # prepare an init node\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    init.run()  # actually initialize all the variables\\n    result = f.eval()\\nInside Jupyter or within a Python shell you may prefer to create an InteractiveSes\\nsion.

The construction phase typically builds a computation graph\\nrepresenting the ML model and the computations required to train it.

Finally,\\nthe code runs the graph to evaluate z. Once again, TensorFlow detects that it must\\nfirst evaluate w and x.

Simply replace the gradients = ...\\nline in the Gradient Descent code in the previous section with the following line, and\\nthe code will continue to work just fine:\\ngradients = tf.gradients(mse, [theta])[0]\\nThe gradients() function takes an op (in this case mse) and a list of variables (in this\\ncase just theta), and it creates a list of ops (one per variable) to compute the gradi‐\\nents of the op with regards to each variable. So the gradients node will compute the\\ngradient vector of the MSE with regards to theta.\\n238 | Chapter 9: Up and Running with TensorFlow\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The second\\n(optional) parameter is the graph you want to visualize.

The\\nidea is to use the get_variable() function to create the shared variable if it does not\\nexist yet, or reuse it if it already exists. The desired behavior (creating or reusing) is\\ncontrolled by an attribute of the current variable_scope(). For example, the follow‐\\ning code will create a variable named \"relu/threshold\" (as a scalar, since shape=(),\\nand using 0.0 as the initial value):\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"relu\"):\\n    threshold = tf.get_variable(\"threshold\", shape=(),\\n                                initializer=tf.constant_initializer(0.0))\\nNote that if the variable has already been created by an earlier call to get_vari\\nable(), this code will raise an exception. This behavior prevents reusing variables by\\nmistake. If you want to reuse a variable, you need to explicitly say so by setting the\\nvariable scope’s reuse attribute to True (in which case you don’t have to specify the\\nshape or the initializer):\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"relu\", reuse=True):\\n    threshold = tf.get_variable(\"threshold\")\\nThis code will fetch the existing \"relu/threshold\" variable, or raise an exception if it\\ndoes not exist or if it was not created using get_variable(). Alternatively, you can\\nset the reuse attribute to True inside the block by calling the scope’s reuse_vari\\nables() method:\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"relu\") as scope:\\n    scope.reuse_variables()\\n    threshold = tf.get_variable(\"threshold\")\\nOnce reuse is set to True, it cannot be set back to False within the\\nblock. Moreover, if you define other variable scopes inside this one,\\nthey will automatically inherit reuse=True. Lastly, only variables\\ncreated by get_variable() can be reused this way.\\nSharing Variables | 249\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Pitts (1943).\\nFrom Biological to Artificial Neurons\\nSurprisingly, ANNs ha\\nve been around for quite a while: they were first introduced\\nback in 1943 by the neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and the mathematician\\nWalter Pitts. In their landmark paper, 2 “ A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in\\nNervous Activity, ” McCulloch and Pitts presented a simplified computational model\\nof how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to perform complex\\ncomputations using propositional logic. This was the first artificial neural network\\narchitecture. Since then many other architectures have been invented, as we will see.\\nThe early successes of ANNs until the 1960s led to the widespread belief that we\\nwould soon be conversing with truly intelligent machines. When it became clear that\\nthis promise would go unfulfilled (at least for quite a while), funding flew elsewhere\\nand ANNs entered a long dark era. In the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in\\nANNs as new network architectures were invented and better training techniques\\nwere developed. But by the 1990s, powerful alternative Machine Learning techniques\\nsuch as Support Vector Machines (see Chapter 5) were favored by most researchers,\\nas they seemed to offer better results and stronger theoretical foundations. Finally, we\\nare now witnessing yet another wave of interest in ANNs. Will this wave die out like\\nthe previous ones did?

It is an unusual-looking cell mostly found in animal cerebral\\ncortexes (e.g., your brain), composed of a cell body containing the nucleus and most\\nof the cell’s complex components, and many branching extensions called dendrites,\\nplus one very long extension called the axon. The axon’s length may be just a few\\ntimes longer than the cell body, or up to tens of thousands of times longer. Near its\\nextremity the axon splits off into many branches called telodendria, and at the tip of\\nthese branches are minuscule structures called synaptic terminals (or simply synap‐\\nses), which are connected to the dendrites (or directly to the cell body) of other neu‐\\nrons. Biological neurons receive short electrical impulses called signals from other\\nneurons via these synapses. When a neuron receives a sufficient number of signals\\nfrom other neurons within a few milliseconds, it fires its own signals.\\nFigure 10-1. Biological neuron3\\nThus, individual biological neurons seem to beha ve in a ra\\nther simple way, but they\\nare organized in a vast network of billions of neurons, each neuron typically connec‐\\nted to thousands of other neurons. Highly complex computations can be performed\\nby a vast network of fairly simple neurons, much like a complex anthill can emerge\\nfrom the combined efforts of simple ants.

The last\\nstep of the backpropagation algorithm is a Gradient Descent step on all the connec‐\\ntion weights in the network, using the error gradients measured earlier.\\nLet’s make this even shorter: for each training instance the backpropagation algo‐\\nrithm first makes a prediction (forward pass), measures the error, then goes through\\neach layer in reverse to measure the error contribution from each connection (reverse\\npass), and finally slightly tweaks the connection weights to reduce the error (Gradient\\nDescent step).\\nIn order for this algorithm to work properly, the authors made a key change to the\\nMLP’s architecture: they replaced the step function with the logistic function, σ(z) =\\n1 / (1 + exp(–z)). This was essential because the step function contains only flat seg‐\\nments, so there is no gradient to work with (Gradient Descent cannot move on a flat\\nsurface), while the logistic function has a well-defined nonzero derivative every‐\\nwhere, allowing Gradient Descent to make some progress at every step. The backpro‐\\npagation algorithm may be used with other activation functions, instead of the logistic\\nfunction. Two other popular activation functions are:\\nThe hyperbolic tangent function tanh (z) = 2σ(2z) – 1\\nJust like the logistic function it is S-sha\\nped, continuous, and differentiable, but its\\noutput value ranges from –1 to 1 (instead of 0 to 1 in the case of the logistic func‐\\ntion), which tends to make each layer’s output more or less normalized (i.e., cen‐\\ntered around 0) at the beginning of training.

It is continuous but unfortunately not differentiable at z =\\n0 (the slope changes abruptly, which can make Gradient Descent bounce\\naround).

In this section we\\nwill build the same model as before using this API, and we will implement Mini-\\nbatch Gradient Descent to train it on the MNIST dataset. The first step is the con‐\\nstruction phase, building the TensorFlow graph. The second step is the execution\\nphase, where you actually run the graph to train the model.\\nConstruction Phase\\nLet’s start. First we need to import the tensorflow library. Then we must specify the\\nnumber of inputs and outputs, and set the number of hidden neurons in each layer:\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nn_inputs = 28*28  # MNIST\\nn_hidden1 = 300\\nn_hidden2 = 100\\nn_outputs = 10\\nNext, just like you did in Chapter 9, you can use placeholder nodes to represent the\\ntraining data and targets. The shape of X is only partially defined. We know that it will\\nbe a 2D tensor (i.e., a matrix), with instances along the first dimension and features\\nalong the second dimension, and we know that the number of features is going to be\\n28 x 28 (one feature per pixel), but we don’t know yet how many instances each train‐\\ning batch will contain. So the shape of X is (None, n_inputs). Similarly, we know\\nthat y will be a 1D tensor with one entry per instance, but again we don’t know the\\nsize of the training batch at this point, so the shape is (None).\\nX = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, n_inputs), name=\"X\")\\ny = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=(None), name=\"y\")\\nNow let’s create the actual neural network. The placeholder X will act as the input\\nlayer; during the execution phase, it will be replaced with one training batch at a time\\n(note that all the instances in a training batch will be processed simultaneously by the\\nneural network). Now you need to create the two hidden layers and the output layer.\\nThe two hidden layers are almost identical: they differ only by the inputs they are\\nconnected to and by the number of neurons they contain. The output layer is also\\nvery similar, but it uses a softmax activation function instead of a ReLU activation\\nfunction. So let’s create a neuron_layer() function that we will use to create one layer\\nat a time. It will need parameters to specify the inputs, the number of neurons, the\\nactivation function, and the name of the layer:\\ndef neuron_layer(X, n_neurons, name, activation=None):\\n    with tf.name_scope(name):\\n        n_inputs = int(X.get_shape()[1])\\nTraining a DNN Using Plain TensorFlow | 265\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Each\\nmini-batch is fetched via the next_batch() method, and then the code simply runs\\nthe training operation, feeding it the current mini-batch input data and targets.

Y ou would have to draw each tree\\nindividually, branch per branch, leaf per leaf. If you could instead draw one leaf,\\ncopy/paste it to draw a branch, then copy/paste that branch to create a tree, and\\nfinally copy/paste this tree to make a forest, you would be finished in no time. Real-\\nworld data is often structured in such a hierarchical way and DNNs automatically\\ntake advantage of this fact: lower hidden layers model low-level structures (e.g., line\\nsegments of various shapes and orientations), intermediate hidden layers combine\\nthese low-level structures to model intermediate-level structures (e.g., squares, cir‐\\ncles), and the highest hidden layers and the output layer combine these intermediate\\nstructures to model high-level structures (e.g., faces).\\nNot only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good sol‐\\nution, it also improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. For example, if you\\nhave already trained a model to recognize faces in pictures, and you now want to\\ntrain a new neural network to recognize hairstyles, then you can kickstart training by\\nreusing the lower layers of the first network. Instead of randomly initializing the\\nweights and biases of the first few layers of the new neural network, you can initialize\\nthem to the value of the weights and biases of the lower layers of the first network.\\nThis way the network will not have to learn from scratch all the low-level structures\\nthat occur in most pictures; it will only have to learn the higher-level structures (e.g.,\\nhairstyles).\\nIn summary, for many problems you can start with just one or two hidden layers and\\nit will work just fine (e.g., you can easily reach above 97% accuracy on the MNIST\\ndataset using just one hidden layer with a few hundred neurons, and above 98% accu‐\\nracy using two hidden layers with the same total amount of neurons, in roughly the\\nsame amount of training time). For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp\\nup the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set. Very com‐\\nplex tasks, such as large image classification or speech recognition, typically require\\nnetworks with dozens of layers (or even hundreds, but not fully connected ones, as\\nwe will see in Chapter 13), and they need a huge amount of training data. However,\\nyou will rarely have to train such networks from scratch: it is much more common to\\nreuse parts of a pretrained state-of-the-art network that performs a similar task.\\nTraining will be a lot faster and require much less data (we will discuss this in Chap‐\\nter 11).\\nFine-Tuning Neural Network Hyperparameters | 271\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

For example, the MNIST task requires 28\\nx 28 = 784 input neurons and 10 output neurons. As for the hidden layers, a common\\npractice is to size them to form a funnel, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer—\\nthe rationale being that many low-level features can coalesce into far fewer high-level\\nfeatures. For example, a typical neural network for MNIST may have two hidden lay‐\\ners, the first with 300 neurons and the second with 100. However, this practice is not\\nas common now, and you may simply use the same size for all hidden layers—for\\nexample, all hidden layers with 150 neurons: that’s just one hyperparameter to tune\\ninstead of one per layer. Just like for the number of layers, you can try increasing the\\nnumber of neurons gradually until the network starts overfitting. In general you will\\nget more bang for the buck by increasing the number of layers than the number of\\nneurons per layer. Unfortunately, as you can see, finding the perfect amount of neu‐\\nrons is still somewhat of a black art.\\nA simpler approach is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you\\nactually need, then use early stopping to prevent it from overfitting (and other regu‐\\nlarization techniques, especially dropout, as we will see in Chapter 11). This has been\\ndubbed the “stretch pants” approach:12 instead of wasting time looking for pants that\\nperfectly match your size, just use large stretch pants that will shrink down to the\\nright size.\\nActivation Functions\\nIn most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden layers (or one\\nof its variants, as we will see in Chapter 11). It is a bit faster to compute than other\\nactivation functions, and Gradient Descent does not get stuck as much on plateaus,\\nthanks to the fact that it does not saturate for large input values (as opposed to the\\nlogistic function or the hyperbolic tangent function, which saturate at 1).\\nFor the output layer, the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for\\nclassification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive). For regression tasks,\\nyou can simply use no activation function at all.\\nThis concludes this introduction to artificial neural networks. In the following chap‐\\nters, we will discuss techniques to train very deep nets, and distribute training across\\nmultiple servers and GPUs. Then we will explore a few other popular neural network\\narchitectures: convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoen‐\\ncoders.13\\n272 | Chapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Glorot, Y Bengio (2010).\\nparameter in the network, it uses these gradients to update each parameter with a\\nGradient Descent step\\n.\\nUnfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses\\ndown to the lower layers. As a result, the Gradient Descent update leaves the lower\\nlayer connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\\nsolution. This is called the vanishing gradients problem. In some cases, the opposite\\ncan happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger, so many layers get insanely\\nlarge weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the exploding gradients prob‐\\nlem, which is mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks (see Chapter 14).\\nMore generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers\\nmay learn at widely different speeds.\\nAlthough this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for quite a while\\n(it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were mostly abandoned for a\\nlong time), it is only around 2010 that significant progress was made in understand‐\\ning it. A paper titled “Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward\\nNeural Networks” by Xavier Glorot and Y oshua Bengio1 found a few suspects, includ‐\\ning the combination of the popular logistic sigmoid activation function and the\\nweight initialization technique that was most popular at the time, namely random ini‐\\ntialization using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\\nIn short, they showed that with this activation function and this initialization scheme,\\nthe variance of the outputs of each layer is much greater than the variance of its\\ninputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer\\nuntil the activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made worse by\\nthe fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0 (the hyperbolic tangent\\nfunction has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly better than the logistic function in deep\\nnetworks).\\nLooking at the logistic activation function (see Figure 11-1), you can see that when\\ninputs become large (negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a\\nderivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in, it has virtually\\nno gradient to propagate back through the network, and what little gradient exists\\nkeeps getting diluted as backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so\\nthere is really nothing left for the lower layers.\\n276 | Chapter 11: Training Deep Neural Nets\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

It is actually not possible to guarantee both unless the layer has an equal\\nnumber of input and output connections, but they proposed a good compromise that\\nhas proven to work very well in practice: the connection weights must be initialized\\nrandomly as described in Equation 11-1, where n inputs and n outputs are the number of\\ninput and output connections for the layer whose weights are being initialized (also\\ncalled fan-in and fan-out).

This is also the\\ndefa\\nult for the variance_scaling_initializer() function, but\\nyou can change this by setting the argument mode=\"FAN_AVG\".\\nNonsaturating Activation Functions\\nOne of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that the vanishing/\\nexploding gradients problems were in part due to a poor choice of activation func‐\\ntion. Until then most people had assumed that if Mother Nature had chosen to use\\nroughly sigmoid activation functions in biological neurons, they must be an excellent\\nchoice. But it turns out that other activation functions behave much better in deep\\nneural networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because it does\\nnot saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite fast to compute).\\nUnfortunately, the ReLU activation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem\\nknown as the dying ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning\\nthey stop outputting anything other than 0. In some cases, you may find that half of\\nyour network’s neurons are dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During\\ntraining, if a neuron’s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the neuron’s\\ninputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this happen, the neuron is unlikely\\nto come back to life since the gradient of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is\\nnegative.\\nTo solve this problem, you may want to use a variant of the ReLU function, such as\\nthe leaky ReLU. This function is defined as LeakyReLU α(z) = max(αz, z) (see\\nFigure 11-2). The hyperparameter α defines how much the function “leaks”: it is the\\nslope of the function for z < 0, and is typically set to 0.01. This small slope ensures\\nthat leaky ReLUs never die; they can go into a long coma, but they have a chance to\\neventually wake up. A recent paper5 compared several variants of the ReLU activation\\nfunction and one of its conclusions was that the leaky variants always outperformed\\nthe strict ReLU activation function. In fact, setting α = 0.2 (huge leak) seemed to\\nresult in better performance than α = 0.01 (small leak). They also evaluated the\\nrandomized leaky ReLU (RReLU), where α is picked randomly in a given range during\\ntraining, and it is fixed to an average value during testing. It also performed fairly well\\nand seemed to act as a regularizer (reducing the risk of overfitting the training set).\\nFinally, they also evaluated the parametric leaky ReLU (PReLU), where α is authorized\\nto be learned during training (instead of being a hyperparameter, it becomes a\\nparameter that can be modified by backpropagation like any other parameter).

In other words, this operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and\\nmean of the inputs for each layer.\\nIn order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the\\ninputs’ mean and standard deviation.

To avoid repeating the same parameters over\\nand over again, you can create an argument scope using the arg_scope() function:\\nthe first parameter is a list of functions, and the other parameters will be passed to\\nthese functions automatically. The last three lines of the preceding code can be modi‐\\nfied like so:\\n[...]\\nwith tf.contrib.framework.arg_scope(\\n        [fully_connected],\\n        normalizer_fn=batch_norm,\\n        normalizer_params=bn_params):\\n    hidden1 = fully_connected(X, n_hidden1, scope=\"hidden1\")\\n    hidden2 = fully_connected(hidden1, n_hidden2, scope=\"hidden2\")\\n    logits = fully_connected(hidden2, n_outputs, scope=\"outputs\",\\n                             activation_fn=None)\\nIt may not look much better than before in this small example, but if you have 10 lay‐\\ners and want to set the activation function, the initializers, the normalizers, the regu‐\\nlarizers, and so on, it will make your code much more readable.\\nThe rest of the construction phase is the same as in Chapter 10: define the cost func‐\\ntion, create an optimizer, tell it to minimize the cost function, define the evaluation\\noperations, create a Saver, and so on.\\nThe execution phase is also pretty much the same, with one exception. Whenever you\\nrun an operation that depends on the batch_norm layer, you need to set the is_train\\ning placeholder to True or False:\\nVanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems | 285\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

This is called Gradient\\nClipping.8 In general people now prefer Batch Normalization, but it’s still useful to\\nknow about Gradient Clipping and how to implement it.\\nIn TensorFlow, the optimizer’s minimize() function takes care of both computing the\\ngradients and applying them, so you must instead call the optimizer’s compute_gradi\\nents() method first, then create an operation to clip the gradients using the\\nclip_by_value() function, and finally create an operation to apply the clipped gradi‐\\nents using the optimizer’s apply_gradients() method:\\nthreshold = 1.0\\noptimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)\\ngrads_and_vars = optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)\\ncapped_gvs = [(tf.clip_by_value(grad, -threshold, threshold), var)\\n              for grad, var in grads_and_vars]\\ntraining_op = optimizer.apply_gradients(capped_gvs)\\nY ou would then run this training_op at every training step, as usual. It will compute\\nthe gradients, clip them between –1.0 and 1.0, and apply them. The threshold is a\\nhyperparameter you can tune.\\nReusing Pretrained Layers\\nIt is generally not a good idea to train a very large DNN from scratch: instead, you\\nshould always try to find an existing neural network that accomplishes a similar task\\n286 | Chapter 11: Training Deep Neural Nets\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The first place to look is obviously in your own catalog of models. This is one\\ngood reason to save all your models and organize them so you can retrieve them later\\neasily. Another option is to search in a model zoo . Many people train Machine Learn‐\\ning models for various tasks and kindly release their pretrained models to the public.\\nTensorFlow has its own model zoo available at https://github.com/tensorflow/models.\\nIn particular, it contains most of the sta\\nte-of-the-art image classification nets such as\\nVGG, Inception, and ResNet (see Chapter 13, and check out the models/slim direc‐\\ntory), including the code, the pretrained models, and tools to download popular\\nimage datasets.\\nAnother popular model zoo is Caffe’s Model Zoo. It also contains many computer\\nvision models (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, inception) trained\\non various datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Places Database, CIFAR10, etc.). Saumitro Das‐\\ngupta wrote a converter, which is available at https://github.com/ethereon/caffe-\\ntensorflow.\\nUnsupervised Pretraining\\nSuppose you want to tackle a complex task for which you don\\n’t have much labeled\\ntraining data, but unfortunately you cannot find a model trained on a similar task.\\nDon’t lose all hope! First, you should of course try to gather more labeled training\\ndata, but if this is too hard or too expensive, you may still be able to perform unsuper‐\\nvised pretraining (see Figure 11-5). That is, if you have plenty of unlabeled training\\ndata, you can try to train the layers one by one, starting with the lowest layer and then\\ngoing up, using an unsupervised feature detector algorithm such as Restricted Boltz‐\\nmann Machines (RBMs; see Appendix E) or autoencoders (see Chapter 15). Each\\nlayer is trained on the output of the previously trained layers (all layers except the one\\nbeing trained are frozen). Once all layers have been trained this way, you can fine-\\ntune the network using supervised learning (i.e., with backpropagation).\\nThis is a rather long and tedious process, but it often works well; in fact, it is this\\ntechnique that Geoffrey Hinton and his team used in 2006 and which led to the\\nrevival of neural networks and the success of Deep Learning. Until 2010, unsuper‐\\nvised pretraining (typically using RBMs) was the norm for deep nets, and it was only\\nafter the vanishing gradients problem was alleviated that it became much more com‐\\nmon to train DNNs purely using backpropagation. However, unsupervised pretrain‐\\ning (today typically using autoencoders rather than RBMs) is still a good option when\\nReusing Pretrained Layers | 291\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

In this situation, a common technique is to label all your training exam‐\\nples as “good, ” then generate many new training instances by corrupting the good\\nones, and label these corrupted instances as “bad. ” Then you can train a first neural\\nnetwork to classify instances as good or bad. For example, you could download mil‐\\nlions of sentences, label them as “good, ” then randomly change a word in each sen‐\\ntence and label the resulting sentences as “bad. ” If a neural network can tell that “The\\ndog sleeps” is a good sentence but “The dog they” is bad, it probably knows quite a lot\\nabout language. Reusing its lower layers will likely help in many language processing\\ntasks.\\nAnother approach is to train a first network to output a score for each training\\ninstance, and use a cost function that ensures that a good instance’s score is greater\\nthan a bad instance’s score by at least some margin. This is called max margin learn‐\\ning.\\nFaster Optimizers\\nTraining a very large deep neural network can be painfully slow. So far we have seen\\nfour ways to speed up training (and reach a better solution): applying a good initiali‐\\nzation strategy for the connection weights, using a good activation function, using\\nBatch Normalization, and reusing parts of a pretrained network. Another huge speed\\nboost comes from using a faster optimizer than the regular Gradient Descent opti‐\\nmizer. In this section we will present the most popular ones: Momentum optimiza‐\\ntion, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and finally Adam\\noptimization.\\nSpoiler alert: the conclusion of this section is that you should almost always use \\nAdam optimization,10 so if you don’t care about how it works, simply replace your\\nGradientDescentOptimizer with an AdamOptimizer and skip to the next section!\\nWith just this small change, training will typically be several times faster. However,\\nAdam optimization does have three hyperparameters that you can tune (plus the\\nlearning rate); the default values usually work fine, but if you ever need to tweak them\\nit may be helpful to know what they do. Adam optimization combines several ideas\\nfrom other optimization algorithms, so it is useful to look at these algorithms first.\\nFaster Optimizers | 293\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Polyak (1964).\\nMomentum optimization\\nImagine a bowling ball rolling down a gentle slope on a smooth surface: it will start\\nout slowly, but it will quickly pick up momen\\ntum until it eventually reaches terminal\\nvelocity (if there is some friction or air resistance). This is the very simple idea behind\\nMomentum optimization, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964. 11 In contrast, regular\\nGradient Descent will simply take small regular steps down the slope, so it will take\\nmuch more time to reach the bottom.\\nRecall that Gradient Descent simply updates the weights θ by directly subtracting the\\ngradient of the cost function J(θ) with regards to the weights (∇ θJ(θ)) multiplied by\\nthe learning rate η. The equation is: θ ← θ – η∇ θJ(θ). It does not care about what the\\nearlier gradients were. If the local gradient is tiny, it goes very slowly.\\nMomentum optimization cares a great deal about what previous gradients were: at\\neach iteration, it adds the local gradient to the momentum vector m (multiplied by the\\nlearning rate η), and it updates the weights by simply subtracting this momentum\\nvector (see Equation 11-4). In other words, the gradient is used as an acceleration, not\\nas a speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the momentum\\nfrom growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter β, simply\\ncalled the momentum, which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1 (no friction).\\nA typical momentum value is 0.9.\\nEquation 11-4. Momentum algorithm\\n1 . \\ud835\\nβ\\ud835+ η∇θJ θ\\n2 . θ θ − \\ud835\\nY ou can easily verify that if the gradient remains constant, the terminal velocity (i.e.,\\nthe maximum size of the weigh t upda\\ntes) is equal to that gradient multiplied by the\\nlearning rate η multiplied by 1\\n1 − β . For example, if β = 0.9, then the terminal velocity\\nis equal to 10 times the gradient times the learning rate, so Momentum optimization\\nends up going 10 times faster than Gradient Descent! This allows Momentum opti‐\\nmization to escape from plateaus much faster than Gradient Descent. In particular,\\nwe saw in Chapter 4 that when the inputs have very different scales the cost function\\nwill look like an elongated bowl (see Figure 4-7). Gradient Descent goes down the\\nsteep slope quite fast, but then it takes a very long time to go down the valley. In con‐\\ntrast, Momentum optimization will roll down the bottom of the valley faster and\\nfaster until it reaches the bottom (the optimum). In deep neural networks that don’t\\nuse Batch Normalization, the upper layers will often end up having inputs with very\\n294 | Chapter 11: Training Deep Neural Nets\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The ideal learning rate will learn quickly and converge to good solution.\\nHowever, you can do better than a constant learning rate: if you start with a high\\nlearning rate and then reduce it once it stops making fast progress, you can reach a\\ngood solution faster than with the optimal constant learning rate.

These strategies are called\\nlearning schedules (we briefly introduced this concept in Chapter 4), the most com‐\\nmon of which are:\\nPredetermined piecewise constant learning rate\\nFor example, set the learning rate to η 0 = 0.1 at first, then to η 1 = 0.001 after 50\\nepochs. Although this solution can work very well, it often requires fiddling\\naround to figure out the right learning rates and when to use them.\\nPerformance scheduling\\nMeasure the validation error every N steps (just like for early stopping) and\\nreduce the learning rate by a factor of λ when the error stops dropping.\\nExponential scheduling\\nSet the learning rate to a function of the iteration number t: η(t) = η 0 10–t/r. This\\nworks great, but it requires tuning η 0 and r. The learning rate will drop by a fac‐\\ntor of 10 every r steps.\\nPower scheduling\\nSet the learning rate to η(t) = η 0 (1 + t/r) –c. The hyperparameter c is typically set\\nto 1.

In this section we will present\\nsome of the most popular regulariza tion techniques for neural networks, and how to\\nimplemen\\nt them with TensorFlow: early stopping, ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 regularization, dropout,\\nmax-norm regularization, and data augmentation.\\nEarly Stopping\\nTo avoid overfitting the training set, a great solution is early stopping (introduced in\\nChapter 4): just interrupt training when its performance on the validation set starts\\ndropping.\\nOne way to implement this with TensorFlow is to evaluate the model on a validation\\nset at regular intervals (e.g., every 50 steps), and save a “winner” snapshot if it outper‐\\nforms previous “winner” snapshots. Count the number of steps since the last “win‐\\nner” snapshot was saved, and interrupt training when this number reaches some limit\\n(e.g., 2,000 steps). Then restore the last “winner” snapshot.\\nAlthough early stopping works very well in practice, you can usually get much higher\\nperformance out of your network by combining it with other regularization techni‐\\nques.\\nℓ1 and ℓ2 Regularization\\nJust like you did in Chapter 4 for simple linear models, you can use ℓ1 and ℓ2 regulari‐\\nzation to constrain a neural network’s connection weights (but typically not its bia‐\\nses).\\nOne way to do this using TensorFlow is to simply add the appropriate regularization\\nterms to your cost function. For example, assuming you have just one hidden layer\\nwith weights weights1 and one output layer with weights weights2, then you can\\napply ℓ1 regularization like this:\\n[...] # construct the neural network\\nbase_loss = tf.reduce_mean(xentropy, name=\"avg_xentropy\")\\nreg_losses = tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weights1)) + tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weights2))\\nloss = tf.add(base_loss, scale * reg_losses, name=\"loss\")\\nHowever, if there are many layers, this approach is not very convenient. Fortunately,\\nTensorFlow provides a better option. Many functions that create variables (such as\\nget_variable() or fully_connected()) accept a *_regularizer argument for each\\ncreated variable (e.g., weights_regularizer). Y ou can pass any function that takes\\nweights as an argument and returns the corresponding regularization loss. The\\nl1_regularizer(), l2_regularizer(), and l1_l2_regularizer() functions return \\nsuch functions.

This\\nmay not sound like a lot, but when a model already has 95% accuracy, getting a 2%\\naccuracy boost means dropping the error rate by almost 40% (going from 5% error to\\nroughly 3%).\\nIt is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the\\ninput neurons but excluding the output neurons) has a probability p of being tem‐\\nporarily “dropped out, ” meaning it will be entirely ignored during this training step,\\nbut it may be active during the next step (see Figure 11-9). The hyperparameter p is\\ncalled the dropout rate, and it is typically set to 50%. After training, neurons don’t get\\ndropped anymore.

Dropout regularization\\nIt is quite surprising a t first tha\\nt this rather brutal technique works at all. Would a\\ncompany perform better if its employees were told to toss a coin every morning to\\ndecide whether or not to go to work? Well, who knows; perhaps it would! The com‐\\npany would obviously be forced to adapt its organization; it could not rely on any sin‐\\ngle person to fill in the coffee machine or perform any other critical tasks, so this\\nexpertise would have to be spread across several people. Employees would have to\\nlearn to cooperate with many of their coworkers, not just a handful of them. The\\ncompany would become much more resilient. If one person quit, it wouldn’t make\\nmuch of a difference. It’s unclear whether this idea would actually work for compa‐\\nnies, but it certainly does for neural networks. Neurons trained with dropout cannot\\nco-adapt with their neighboring neurons; they have to be as useful as possible on\\ntheir own. They also cannot rely excessively on just a few input neurons; they must\\npay attention to each of their input neurons. They end up being less sensitive to slight\\nchanges in the inputs. In the end you get a more robust network that generalizes bet‐\\nter.\\nAnother way to understand the power of dropout is to realize that a unique neural\\nnetwork is generated at each training step. Since each neuron can be either present or\\nabsent, there is a total of 2 N possible networks (where N is the total number of drop‐\\npable neurons). This is such a huge number that it is virtually impossible for the same\\nneural network to be sampled twice. Once you have run a 10,000 training steps, you\\nhave essentially trained 10,000 different neural networks (each with just one training\\ninstance). These neural networks are obviously not independent since they share\\nmany of their weights, but they are nevertheless all different. The resulting neural\\nnetwork can be seen as an averaging ensemble of all these smaller neural networks.\\nThere is one small but important technical detail. Suppose p = 50, in which case dur‐\\ning testing a neuron will be connected to twice as many input neurons as it was (on\\naverage) during training.

If we don’t, each neuron will get a\\ntotal input signal roughly twice as large as wha t the network was trained on, and it is\\nunlikely to perform well. M\\nore generally, we need to multiply each input connection\\nweight by the keep probability (1 – p) after training. Alternatively, we can divide each\\nneuron’s output by the keep probability during training (these alternatives are not\\nperfectly equivalent, but they work equally well).\\nTo implement dropout using TensorFlow, you can simply apply the dropout() func‐\\ntion to the input layer and to the output of every hidden layer. During training, this\\nfunction randomly drops some items (setting them to 0) and divides the remaining\\nitems by the keep probability. After training, this function does nothing at all. The\\nfollowing code applies dropout regularization to our three-layer neural network:\\nfrom tensorflow.contrib.layers import dropout\\n[...]\\nis_training = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=(), name=\\'is_training\\')\\nkeep_prob = 0.5\\nX_drop = dropout(X, keep_prob, is_training=is_training)\\nhidden1 = fully_connected(X_drop, n_hidden1, scope=\"hidden1\")\\nhidden1_drop = dropout(hidden1, keep_prob, is_training=is_training)\\nhidden2 = fully_connected(hidden1_drop, n_hidden2, scope=\"hidden2\")\\nhidden2_drop = dropout(hidden2, keep_prob, is_training=is_training)\\nlogits = fully_connected(hidden2_drop, n_outputs, activation_fn=None,\\n                         scope=\"outputs\")\\nY ou want to use the dropout() function in tensorflow.con\\ntrib.layers, not the one in tensorflow.nn.

Conversely, you should try decreasing the\\ndropout rate (i.e., increasing keep_prob) if the model underfits the training set. It can\\nalso help to increase the dropout rate for large layers, and reduce it for small ones.\\nDropout does tend to significantly slow down convergence, but it usually results in a\\nmuch better model when tuned properly.

The trick is to\\ngenerate realistic training instances; ideally, a human should not be able to tell which\\ninstances were generated and which ones were not. Moreover, simply adding white\\nnoise will not help; the modifications you apply should be learnable (white noise is\\nnot).\\nFor example, if your model is meant to classify pictures of mushrooms, you can\\nslightly shift, rotate, and resize every picture in the training set by various amounts\\nand add the resulting pictures to the training set (see Figure 11-10). This forces the\\nmodel to be more tolerant to the position, orientation, and size of the mushrooms in\\nthe picture. If you want the model to be more tolerant to lighting conditions, you can\\nsimilarly generate many images with various contrasts.

The reason it was left out seems to be that in practice a small set of place‐\\nment rules specified by the user actually results in more efficient placement than what\\nthe dynamic placer is capable of. However, the TensorFlow team is working on\\nimproving the dynamic placer, and perhaps it will eventually be good enough to be\\nreleased.\\nUntil then TensorFlow relies on the simple placer, which (as its name suggests) is very\\nbasic.\\nSimple placement\\nWhenever you run a graph, if TensorFlow needs to evaluate a node that is not placed\\non a device yet, it uses the simple placer to place it, along with all other nodes that are\\nnot placed yet. The simple placer respects the following rules:\\n• If a node was already placed on a device in a previous run of the graph, it is left\\non that device.\\n• Else, if the user p\\nin ned a node to a device (described next), the placer places it on\\nthat device.\\n• Else, it defaults to GPU #0, or the CPU if there is no GPU.\\nAs you can see, placing operations on the appropria\\nte device is mostly up to you. If\\nyou don’t do anything, the whole graph will be placed on the default device. To pin\\nnodes onto a device, you must create a device block using the device() function. For\\nexample, the following code pins the variable a and the constant b on the CPU, but\\nthe multiplication node c is not pinned on any device, so it will be placed on the \\ndefault device:\\nwith tf.device(\"/cpu:0\"):\\n    a = tf.Variable(3.0)\\n    b = tf.constant(4.0)\\nc = a * b\\nThe \"/cpu:0\" device aggregates all CPUs on a multi-CPU system.\\nThere is currently no way to pin nodes on specific CPUs or to use\\njust a subset of all CPUs.\\nMultiple Devices on a Single Machine | 319\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

For large models with millions of parameters, it is useful to shard\\nthese parameters across multiple parameter servers, to reduce the risk of saturating a\\nsingle parameter server’s network card. If you were to manually pin every variable to\\na different parameter server, it would be quite tedious. Fortunately, TensorFlow pro‐\\nvides the replica_device_setter() function, which distributes variables across all\\nthe \"ps\" tasks in a round-robin fashion. For example, the following code pins five\\nvariables to two parameter servers:\\nwith tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(ps_tasks=2):\\n    v1 = tf.Variable(1.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0\\n    v2 = tf.Variable(2.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:1\\n    v3 = tf.Variable(3.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0\\n    v4 = tf.Variable(4.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:1\\n    v5 = tf.Variable(5.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0\\nInstead of passing the number of ps_tasks, you can pass the cluster spec clus\\nter=cluster_spec and TensorFlow will simply count the number of tasks in the \"ps\"\\njob.\\nIf you create other operations in the block, beyond just variables, TensorFlow auto‐\\nmatically pins them to \"/job:worker\", which will default to the first device managed\\nby the first task in the \"worker\" job. Y ou can pin them to another device by setting\\nthe worker_device parameter, but a better approach is to use embedded device\\nblocks. An inner device block can override the job, task, or device defined in an outer\\nblock. For example:\\nwith tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(ps_tasks=2)):\\n    v1 = tf.Variable(1.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0 (+ defaults to /cpu:0)\\n    v2 = tf.Variable(2.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:1 (+ defaults to /cpu:0)\\n    v3 = tf.Variable(3.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0 (+ defaults to /cpu:0)\\n    [...]\\n    s = v1 + v2            # pinned to /job:worker (+ defaults to task:0/gpu:0)\\n    with tf.device(\"/gpu:1\"):\\n        p1 = 2 * s         # pinned to /job:worker/gpu:1 (+ defaults to /task:0)\\n        with tf.device(\"/task:1\"):\\n            p2 = 3 * s     # pinned to /job:worker/task:1/gpu:1\\nThis example assumes that the parameter servers are CPU-only,\\nwhich is typically the case since they only need to store and com‐\\nmunicate parameters, not perform intensive computations.\\nMultiple Devices Across Multiple Servers | 327\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

For example, the fol‐\\nlowing code pushes three training instances to the queue:\\n# training_data_loader.py\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nq = [...]\\ntraining_instance = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(2))\\nenqueue = q.enqueue([training_instance])\\nwith tf.Session(\"grpc://machine-a.example.com:2222\") as sess:\\n   sess.run(enqueue, feed_dict={training_instance: [1., 2.]})\\n   sess.run(enqueue, feed_dict={training_instance: [3., 4.]})\\n   sess.run(enqueue, feed_dict={training_instance: [5., 6.]})\\n330 | Chapter 12: Distributing TensorFlow Across Devices and Servers\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

What if we want to run a\\nsingle neural network across multiple devices? This requires chopping your model\\ninto separate chunks and running each chunk on a different device.

For fully connected net‐\\nworks, there is generally not much to be gained from this approach (see\\nFigure 12-14). Intuitively, it may seem that an easy way to split the model is to place\\neach layer on a different device, but this does not work since each layer needs to wait\\nfor the output of the previous layer before it can do anything. So perhaps you can\\nslice it vertically—for example, with the left half of each layer on one device, and the\\nright part on another device? This is slightly better, since both halves of each layer can\\nindeed work in parallel, but the problem is that each half of the next layer requires the\\noutput of both halves, so there will be a lot of cross-device communication (repre‐\\nParallelizing Neural Networks on a TensorFlow Cluster | 345\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

In reality, all rep‐\\nlicas are equivalent: they all work hard to be among the fastest at each training step\\n, and the losers vary at\\nevery step (unless some devices are really slower than others).\\nSynchronous updates\\nWith sy\\nnchronous updates, the aggregator waits for all gradients to be available before\\ncomputing the average and applying the result (i.e., using the aggregated gradients to\\nupdate the model parameters). Once a replica has finished computing its gradients, it\\nmust wait for the parameters to be updated before it can proceed to the next mini-\\nbatch. The downside is that some devices may be slower than others, so all other\\ndevices will have to wait for them at every step. Moreover, the parameters will be\\ncopied to every device almost at the same time (immediately after the gradients are\\napplied), which may saturate the parameter servers’ bandwidth.\\nTo reduce the waiting time at each step, you could ignore the gradi‐\\nents from the slowest few replicas (typically ~10%). For example,\\nyou could run 20 replicas, but only aggregate the gradients from\\nthe fastest 18 replicas at each step, and just ignore the gradients\\nfrom the last 2. As soon as the parameters are updated, the first 18\\nreplicas can start working again immediately, without having to\\nwait for the 2 slowest replicas. This setup is generally described as\\nhaving 18 replicas plus 2 spare replicas.5\\nAsynchronous updates\\nWith asynchronous updates, whenever a replica has finished computing the gradi‐\\nents, it immediately uses them to update the model parameters. There is no aggrega‐\\ntion (remove the “mean” step in Figure 12-17), and no synchronization. Replicas just\\nwork independently of the other replicas. Since there is no waiting for the other repli‐\\ncas, this approach runs more training steps per minute. Moreover, although the\\nparameters still need to be copied to every device at every step, this happens at differ‐\\nent times for each replica so the risk of bandwidth saturation is reduced.\\nData parallelism with asynchronous updates is an attractive choice, because of its\\nsimplicity, the absence of synchronization delay, and a better use of the bandwidth.\\nHowever, although it works reasonably well in practice, it is almost surprising that it\\nworks at all! Indeed, by the time a replica has finished computing the gradients based\\non some parameter values, these parameters will have been updated several times by\\nother replicas (on average N – 1 times if there are N replicas) and there is no guaran‐\\ntee that the computed gradients will still be pointing in the right direction (see\\nFigure 12-18).

Why are these tasks so effortless to us humans? The answer lies in the fact that\\nperception largely takes place outside the realm of our consciousness, within special‐\\nized visual, auditory, and other sensory modules in our brains. By the time sensory\\ninformation reaches our consciousness, it is already adorned with high-level features;\\nfor example, when you look at a picture of a cute puppy, you cannot choose not to see\\nthe puppy, or not to notice its cuteness. Nor can you explain how you recognize a cute\\npuppy; it’s just obvious to you. Thus, we cannot trust our subjective experience: per‐\\nception is not trivial at all, and to understand it we must look at how the sensory\\nmodules work.\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) emerged from the study of the brain’s visual\\ncortex, and they have been used in image recognition since the 1980s. In the last few\\nyears, thanks to the increase in computational power, the amount of available training\\ndata, and the tricks presented in Chapter 11 for training deep nets, CNNs have man‐\\naged to achieve superhuman performance on some complex visual tasks.

Hubel and T\\norsten Wiesel performed a series of experiments on cats in\\n19581 and 1959 2 (and a few years later on monkeys 3), giving crucial insights on the\\nstructure of the visual cortex (the authors received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or\\nMedicine in 1981 for their work). In particular, they showed that many neurons in\\nthe visual cortex have a small local receptive field, meaning they react only to visual\\nstimuli located in a limited region of the visual field (see \\nFigure 13-1, in which the\\nlocal receptive fields of five neurons are represented by dashed circles). The receptive\\nfields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual field.\\nMoreover, the authors showed that some neurons react only to images of horizontal\\nlines, while others react only to lines with different orientations (two neurons may\\nhave the same receptive field but react to different line orientations). They also\\nnoticed that some neurons have larger receptive fields, and they react to more com‐\\nplex patterns that are combinations of the lower-level patterns.

It has deep connections with the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform,\\nand is heavily used in signal processing. Convolutional layers actually use cross-correlations, which are very\\nsimilar to convolutions (see http://goo.gl/HAfxXd for more details).\\nand Patrick Haffner, which introduced the famous L eNe t-5 architecture, widely used\\nto recognize handwritten check numbers. This architecture has some building blocks\\nthat you already know, such as fully connected layers and sigmoid activation func‐\\ntions, but it also introduces two new building blocks: convolutional layers  and pooling\\nlayers. Let’s look at them now.\\nWhy not simply use a regular deep neural network with fully con‐\\nnected layers for image recognition tasks? Unfortunately, although\\nthis works fine for small images (e.g., MNIST), it breaks down for\\nlarger images because of the huge number of parameters it\\nrequires. For example, a 100 × 100 image has 10,000 pixels, and if\\nthe first layer has just 1,000 neurons (which already severely\\nrestricts the amount of information transmitted to the next layer),\\nthis means a total of 10 million connections. And that’s just the first\\nlayer. CNNs solve this problem using partially connected layers.\\nConvolutional Layer\\nThe most important building block of a CNN is the convolutional layer: 6 neurons in\\nthe first convolutional layer are not connected to every single pixel in the input image\\n(like they were in previous chapters), but only to pixels in their receptive fields (see\\nFigure 13-2). In turn, each neuron in the second convolutional layer is connected\\nonly to neurons located within a small rectangle in the first layer. This architecture\\nallows the network to concentrate on low-level features in the first hidden layer, then\\nassemble them into higher-level features in the next hidden layer, and so on. This\\nhierarchical structure is common in real-world images, which is one of the reasons\\nwhy CNNs work so well for image recognition.\\nConvolutional Layer | 355\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

But during training\\neverything computed during the forward pass needs to be preserved for the reverse\\npass, so the amount of RAM needed is (at least) the total amount of RAM required by\\nall layers.\\nIf training crashes because of an out-of-memory error, you can try\\nreducing the mini-batch size. Alternatively, you can try reducing\\ndimensionality using a stride, or removing a few layers. Or you can\\ntry using 16-bit floats instead of 32-bit floats. Or you could distrib‐\\nute the CNN across multiple devices.\\nNow let’s look at the second common building block of CNNs: the pooling layer.\\nPooling Layer\\nOnce you understand how convolutional layers work, the pooling layers are quite\\neasy to grasp. Their goal is to subsample (i.e., shrink) the input image in order to\\nreduce the computational load, the memory usage, and the number of parameters\\n(thereby limiting the risk of overfitting). Reducing the input image size also makes\\nthe neural network tolerate a little bit of image shift (location invariance).\\nJust like in convolutional layers, each neuron in a pooling layer is connected to the\\noutputs of a limited number of neurons in the previous layer, located within a small\\nrectangular receptive field. Y ou must define its size, the stride, and the padding type,\\njust like before. However, a pooling neuron has no weights; all it does is aggregate the\\ninputs using an aggregation function such as the max or mean. Figure 13-8 shows a\\nmax pooling layer, which is the most common type of pooling layer. In this example,\\nwe use a 2 × 2 pooling kernel, a stride of 2, and no padding. Note that only the max\\ninput value in each kernel makes it to the next layer. The other inputs are dropped.\\nPooling Layer | 363\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The\\nkey to being able to train such a deep network is to use skip connections (also called\\nshortcut connections): the signal feeding into a layer is also added to the output of a\\nlayer located a bit higher up the stack. Let’s see why this is useful.\\nWhen training a neural network, the goal is to make it model a target function h(x).\\nIf you add the input x to the output of the network (i.e., you add a skip connection),\\nthen the network will be forced to model f(x) = h(x) – x rather than h(x).

Predicting the future is what you do all the time, whether you are finishing\\na friend’s sentence or anticipating the smell of coffee at breakfast. In this chapter, we\\nare going to discuss recurrent neural networks (RNN), a class of nets that can predict\\nthe future (well, up to a point, of course). They can analyze time series data such as\\nstock prices, and tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they\\ncan anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally, they can work\\non sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we\\nhave discussed so far. For example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio\\nsamples as input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing\\n(NLP) systems such as automatic translation, speech-to-text, or sentiment analysis \\n(e.g., reading movie reviews and extracting the rater’s feeling about the movie).\\nMoreover, RNNs’ ability to anticipate also makes them capable of surprising creativ‐\\nity. Y ou can ask them to predict which are the most likely next notes in a melody, then\\nrandomly pick one of these notes and play it. Then ask the net for the next most likely\\nnotes, play it, and repeat the process again and again. Before you know it, your net\\nwill compose a melody such as the one produced by Google’s Magenta project. Simi‐\\nlarly, RNNs can generate sentences, image captions, and much more.

Along the way, as\\nalways, we will show how to implement RNNs using TensorFlow.

Now let’s look at how to create the\\nsame model using TensorFlow’s RNN operations.\\nStatic Unrolling Through Time\\nThe static_rnn() function creates an unrolled RNN network by chaining cells. The\\nfollowing code creates the exact same model as the previous one:\\nX0 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_inputs])\\nX1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_inputs])\\nbasic_cell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicRNNCell(num_units=n_neurons)\\noutput_seqs, states = tf.contrib.rnn.static_rnn(\\n                          basic_cell, [X0, X1], dtype=tf.float32)\\nY0, Y1 = output_seqs\\nFirst we create the input placeholders, as before. Then we create a BasicRNNCell,\\nwhich you can think of as a factory that creates copies of the cell to build the unrolled\\nRNN (one for each time step). Then we call static_rnn(), giving it the cell factory\\nand the input tensors, and telling it the data type of the inputs (this is used to create\\nthe initial state matrix, which by default is full of zeros). The static_rnn() function\\ncalls the cell factory’s __call__() function once per input, creating two copies of the\\ncell (each containing a layer of five recurrent neurons), with shared weights and bias\\nterms, and it chains them just like we did earlier. The static_rnn() function returns\\ntwo objects. The first is a Python list containing the output tensors for each time step.\\nThe second is a tensor containing the final states of the network. When you are using\\nbasic cells, the final state is simply equal to the last output.\\nIf there were 50 time steps, it would not be very convenient to have to define 50 input\\nplaceholders and 50 output tensors. Moreover, at execution time you would have to\\nfeed each of the 50 placeholders and manipulate the 50 outputs. Let’s simplify this.\\nThe following code builds the same RNN again, but this time it takes a single input\\nplaceholder of shape [None, n_steps, n_inputs] where the first dimension is the\\nmini-batch size. Then it extracts the list of input sequences for each time step. X_seqs\\nis a Python list of n_steps tensors of shape [None, n_inputs], where once again the\\nfirst dimension is the mini-batch size. To do this, we first swap the first two dimen‐\\nsions using the transpose() function, so that the time steps are now the first dimen‐\\nsion.

Unfortunately, if you want to\\ntrain an RNN on long sequences, things will get a bit harder . Let’\\ns see why and what\\nyou can do about it.\\nThe Difficulty of Training over Many Time Steps\\nTo train an RNN on long sequences, you will need to run it over man y time steps,\\nmaking the unrolled RNN a ver\\ny deep network. Just like any deep neural network it\\nmay suffer from the vanishing/exploding gradients problem (discussed in Chap‐\\nter 11) and take forever to train. Many of the tricks we discussed to alleviate this\\nproblem can be used for deep unrolled RNNs as well: good parameter initialization,\\nnonsaturating activation functions (e.g., ReLU), Batch Normalization, Gradient Clip‐\\nping, and faster optimizers. However, if the RNN needs to handle even moderately\\nlong sequences (e.g., 100 inputs), then training will still be very slow.\\nThe simplest and most common solution to this problem is to unroll the RNN only\\nover a limited number of time steps during training. This is called truncated backpro‐\\npagation through time. In TensorFlow you can implement it simply by truncating the\\ninput sequences. For example, in the time series prediction problem, you would sim‐\\nply reduce n_steps during training. The problem, of course, is that the model will\\nnot be able to learn long-term patterns. One workaround could be to make sure that\\nthese shortened sequences contain both old and recent data, so that the model can\\nlearn to use both (e.g., the sequence could contain monthly data for the last five\\nmonths, then weekly data for the last five weeks, then daily data over the last five\\ndays). But this workaround has its limits: what if fine-grained data from last year is\\nactually useful? What if there was a brief but significant event that absolutely must be\\ntaken into account, even years later (e.g., the result of an election)?\\nBesides the long training time, a second problem faced by long-running RNNs is the\\nfact that the memory of the first inputs gradually fades away. Indeed, due to the trans‐\\nformations that the data goes through when traversing an RNN, some information is\\nlost after each time step. After a while, the RNN’s state contains virtually no trace of\\nthe first inputs. This can be a showstopper. For example, say you want to perform\\nsentiment analysis on a long review that starts with the four words “I loved this\\nmovie, ” but the rest of the review lists the many things that could have made the\\nmovie even better. If the RNN gradually forgets the first four words, it will completely\\nmisinterpret the review. To solve this problem, various types of cells with long-term\\nmemory have been introduced. They have proved so successful that the basic cells are\\nnot much used anymore. Let’s first look at the most popular of these long memory\\ncells: the LSTM cell.\\n400 | Chapter 14: Recurrent Neural Networks\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Y ou\\ncan think of h(t) as the short-term state and c(t) as the long-term state.\\nNow let’s open the box! The key idea is that the network can learn what to store in the\\nlong-term state, what to throw away, and what to read from it. As the long-term state\\nc(t–1) traverses the network from left to right, you can see that it first goes through a\\nforget gate, dropping some memories, and then it adds some new memories via the\\naddition operation (which adds the memories that were selected by an input gate).\\nThe result c(t) is sent straight out, without any further transformation. So, at each time\\nstep, some memories are dropped and some memories are added. Moreover, after the\\naddition operation, the long-term state is copied and passed through the tanh func‐\\ntion, and then the result is filtered by the output gate. This produces the short-term\\nstate h(t) (which is equal to the cell’s output for this time step y (t)). Now let’s look at\\nwhere new memories come from and how the gates work.\\nFirst, the current input vector x (t) and the previous short-term state h (t–1) are fed to\\nfour different fully connected layers. They all serve a different purpose:\\n• The main layer is the one that outputs g (t). It has the usual role of analyzing the\\ncurrent in\\nputs x(t) and the previous (short-term) state h(t–1). In a basic cell, there is\\nnothing else than this layer, and its output goes straight out to y(t) and h(t). In con‐\\ntrast, in an LSTM cell this layer’s output does not go straight out, but instead it is\\npartially stored in the long-term state.\\n• The three other layers are gat e c ontrollers. Since they use the logistic activation\\nfunction, their outputs range from 0 to 1. As you can see, their outputs are fed to\\nelement-wise multiplication operations, so if they output 0s, they close the gate,\\nand if they output 1s, they open it. Specifically:\\n— The forget gate (controlled by f (t )) controls which parts of the long-term state\\nshould be erased.\\n— The input gate (controlled by i (t )) controls which parts of g (t) should be added\\nto the long-term state (this is why we said it was only “partially stored”).\\n— Finally, the outp ut gate (controlled by o (t)) controls which parts of the long-\\nterm state should be read and output at this time step (both to h(t)) and y(t).\\nIn short, an LSTM cell can learn to recognize an important input (that’s the role of the\\ninput gate), store it in the long-term state, learn to preserve it for as long as it is\\nneeded (that’s the role of the forget gate), and learn to extract it whenever it is needed.\\nThis explains why they have been amazingly successful at capturing long-term pat‐\\nterns in time series, long texts, audio recordings, and more.\\n402 | Chapter 14: Recurrent Neural Networks\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

One option could be to\\nrepresent each word using a one-hot vector. Suppose your vocabulary contains\\n50,000 words, then the nth word would be represented as a 50,000-dimensional vector,\\nfull of 0s except for a 1 at the n th position. However, with such a large vocabulary, this\\nsparse representation would not be efficient at all. Ideally, you want similar words to\\nhave similar representations, making it easy for the model to generalize what it learns\\nabout a word to all similar words.

But how can you come up with such a meaningful rep‐\\nresenta\\ntion?\\nThe most common solution is to represent each word in the vocabulary using a fairly\\nsmall and dense vector (e.g., 150 dimensions), called an embedding, and just let the\\nneural network learn a good embedding for each word during training. At the begin‐\\nning of training, embeddings are simply chosen randomly, but during training, back‐\\npropagation automatically moves the embeddings around in a way that helps the\\nneural network perform its task. Typically this means that similar words will gradu‐\\nally cluster close to one another, and even end up organized in a rather meaningful\\nway. For example, embeddings may end up placed along various axes that represent\\ngender, singular/plural, adjective/noun, and so on. The result can be truly amazing.9\\nIn TensorFlow, you first need to create the variable representing the embeddings for\\nevery word in your vocabulary (initialized randomly):\\nvocabulary_size = 50000\\nembedding_size = 150\\nembeddings = tf.Variable(\\n    tf.random_uniform([vocabulary_size, embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0))\\nNow suppose you want to feed the sentence “I drink milk” to your neural network.\\nY ou should first preprocess the sentence and break it into a list of known words. For\\nexample you may remove unnecessary characters, replace unknown words by a pre‐\\ndefined token word such as “[UNK]” , replace numerical values by “[NUM]” , replace\\nURLs by “[URL]” , and so on. Once you have a list of known words, you can look up\\neach word’s integer identifier (from 0 to 49999) in a dictionary, for example [72, 3335,\\n288]. At that point, you are ready to feed these word identifiers to TensorFlow using a\\nplaceholder, and apply the embedding_lookup() function to get the corresponding\\nembeddings:\\ntrain_inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])  # from ids...\\nembed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, train_inputs)  # ...to embeddings\\nOnce your model has learned good word embeddings, they can actually be reused\\nfairly efficiently in any NLP application: after all, “milk” is still close to “water” and far\\nfrom “shoes” no matter what your application is. In fact, instead of training your own\\nword embeddings, you may want to download pretrained word embeddings. Just like\\nwhen reusing pretrained layers (see Chapter 11), you can choose to freeze the pre‐\\ntrained embeddings (e.g., creating the embeddings variable using trainable=False)\\nor let backpropagation tweak them for your application. The first option will speed\\nup training, but the second may lead to slightly higher performance.\\n406 | Chapter 14: Recurrent Neural Networks\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

There\\nare several ways that this can be handled—for example, using the\\nsequence_length argument to the static_rnn() or dynamic_rnn() functions to\\nspecify each sentence’s length (as discussed earlier). However, another approach\\nis used in the tutorial (presumably for performance reasons): sentences are grou‐\\nped into buckets of similar lengths (e.g., a bucket for the 1- to 6-word sentences,\\nanother for the 7- to 12-word sentences, and so on 11), and the shorter sentences\\nare padded using a special padding token (e.g., “<pad>”). For example “I drink\\nmilk” becomes “<pad> <pad> <pad> milk drink I” , and its translation becomes\\n“Je bois du lait <eos> <pad>” . Of course, we want to ignore any output past the\\nEOS token. For this, the tutorial’s implementation uses a target_weights vector.\\nFor example, for the target sentence “Je bois du lait <eos> <pad>” , the weights\\nwould be set to [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0] (notice the weight 0.0 that\\ncorresponds to the padding token in the target sentence). Simply multiplying the\\nlosses by the target weights will zero out the losses that correspond to words past\\nEOS tokens.\\n• Second, when the output vocabulary is large (which is the case here), outputting\\na probability for each and ever y possible word would be terribly slow . If the tar‐\\nget vocabular\\ny contains, say, 50,000 French words, then the decoder would out‐\\nput 50,000-dimensional vectors, and then computing the softmax function over\\nsuch a large vector would be very computationally intensive. To avoid this, one\\nsolution is to let the decoder output much smaller vectors, such as 1,000-\\ndimensional vectors, then use a sampling technique to estimate the loss without\\nhaving to compute it over every single word in the target vocabulary. This Sam‐\\npled Softmax technique was introduced in 2015 by Sébastien Jean et al .12 In Ten‐\\nsorFlow you can use the sampled_softmax_loss() function.\\n• Third, the tutorial’s implementation uses an att en tion mechanism that lets the\\ndecoder peek into the input sequence. Attention augmented RNNs are beyond\\nthe scope of this book, but if you are interested there are helpful papers about\\nmachine translation,13 machine reading,14 and image captions15 using attention.\\n• Finally, the tutorial’s implementation makes use of the tf.nn.legacy_seq2seq\\nmodule, which provides tools to build various Encoder–Decoder models easily .\\nNatural Language Processing \\n| 409\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

These codings typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input\\ndata, making autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction (see Chapter 8). More\\nimportantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and they can be used for\\nunsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks (as we discussed in Chapter 11).\\nLastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks very similar to the\\ntraining data; this is called a generative model. For example, you could train an\\nautoencoder on pictures of faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.\\nSurprisingly, autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their out‐\\nputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that constraining the network\\nin various ways can make it rather difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the\\ninternal representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the network to\\nrecover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the autoencoder from trivially\\ncopying the inputs directly to the outputs, which forces it to learn efficient ways of\\nrepresenting the data. In short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s\\nattempt to learn the identity function under some constraints.\\nIn this chapter we will explain in more depth how autoencoders work, what types of\\nconstraints can be imposed, and how to implement them using TensorFlow, whether\\nit is for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, unsupervised pretraining, or as\\ngenerative models.\\n411\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Chase and H. Simon (1973).\\nEfficient Data Representations\\nWhich of the following number sequences do you find the easiest to memorize?\\n•\\n40, 27, 25, 36, 81, 57, 10, 73, 19, 68\\n• 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20\\nAt first glance, it would seem tha t the first sequence should be easier\\n, since it is much\\nshorter. However, if you look carefully at the second sequence, you may notice that it\\nfollows two simple rules: even numbers are followed by their half, and odd numbers\\nare followed by their triple plus one (this is a famous sequence known as the hailstone\\nsequence). Once you notice this pattern, the second sequence becomes much easier to\\nmemorize than the first because you only need to memorize the two rules, the first\\nnumber, and the length of the sequence. Note that if you could quickly and easily\\nmemorize very long sequences, you would not care much about the existence of a\\npattern in the second sequence. Y ou would just learn every number by heart, and that\\nwould be that. It is the fact that it is hard to memorize long sequences that makes it\\nuseful to recognize patterns, and hopefully this clarifies why constraining an autoen‐\\ncoder during training pushes it to discover and exploit patterns in the data.\\nThe relationship between memory, perception, and pattern matching was famously\\nstudied by William Chase and Herbert Simon in the early 1970s. 1 They observed that\\nexpert chess players were able to memorize the positions of all the pieces in a game by\\nlooking at the board for just 5 seconds, a task that most people would find impossible.\\nHowever, this was only the case when the pieces were placed in realistic positions\\n(from actual games), not when the pieces were placed randomly. Chess experts don’t\\nhave a much better memory than you and I, they just see chess patterns more easily\\nthanks to their experience with the game. Noticing patterns helps them store infor‐\\nmation efficiently.\\nJust like the chess players in this memory experiment, an autoencoder looks at the\\ninputs, converts them to an efficient internal representation, and then spits out some‐\\nthing that (hopefully) looks very close to the inputs. An autoencoder is always com‐\\nposed of two parts: an encoder (or recognition network) that converts the inputs to an\\ninternal representation, followed by a decoder (or generative network) that converts\\nthe internal representation to the outputs (see Figure 15-1).\\nAs you can see, an autoencoder typically has the same architecture as a Multi-Layer\\nPerceptron (MLP; see Chapter 10), except that the number of neurons in the output\\nlayer must be equal to the number of inputs. In this example, there is just one hidden\\n412 | Chapter 15: Autoencoders\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Let’s take a look.\\nVisualizing Features\\nOnce your autoencoder has learned some features, you may want to take a look at\\nthem. There are various techniques for this. Arguably the simplest technique is to\\nconsider each neuron in every hidden layer, and find the training instances that acti‐\\nvate it the most. This is especially useful for the top hidden layers since they often\\ncapture relatively large features that you can easily spot in a group of training instan‐\\nces that contain them. For example, if a neuron strongly activates when it sees a cat in\\na picture, it will be pretty obvious that the pictures that activate it the most all contain\\ncats. However, for lower layers, this technique does not work so well, as the features\\nare smaller and more abstract, so it’s often hard to understand exactly what the neu‐\\nron is getting all excited about.\\nLet’s look at another technique. For each neuron in the first hidden layer, you can cre‐\\nate an image where a pixel’s intensity corresponds to the weight of the connection to\\nthe given neuron. For example, the following code plots the features learned by five\\nneurons in the first hidden layer:\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    [...] # train autoencoder\\nStacked Autoencoders | 421\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

This makes it possible to train\\na high-performance model using only little training data because your neural net‐\\nwork won’t have to learn all the low-level features; it will just reuse the feature detec‐\\ntors learned by the existing net.\\nSimilarly, if you have a large dataset but most of it is unlabeled, you can first train a\\nstacked autoencoder using all the data, then reuse the lower layers to create a neural\\nnetwork for your actual task, and train it using the labeled data. For example,\\nFigure 15-8 shows how to use a stacked autoencoder to perform unsupervised pre‐\\ntraining for a classification neural network. The stacked autoencoder itself is typically\\ntrained one autoencoder at a time, as discussed earlier.

For example, it may be pushed to\\nhave on average only 5% significantly active neurons in the coding layer. This forces\\nthe autoencoder to represent each input as a combination of a small number of acti‐\\nvations. As a result, each neuron in the coding layer typically ends up representing a\\nuseful feature (if you could speak only a few words per month, you would probably\\ntry to make them worth listening to).\\nIn order to favor sparse models, we must first measure the actual sparsity of the cod‐\\ning layer at each training iteration. We do so by computing the average activation of\\neach neuron in the coding layer, over the whole training batch. The batch size must\\nnot be too small, or else the mean will not be accurate.\\nOnce we have the mean activation per neuron, we want to penalize the neurons that\\nare too active by adding a sparsity loss to the cost function. For example, if we meas‐\\nure that a neuron has an average activation of 0.3, but the target sparsity is 0.1, it must\\nbe penalized to activate less. One approach could be simply adding the squared error\\n(0.3 – 0.1) 2 to the cost function, but in practice a better approach is to use the Kull‐\\nback–Leibler divergence (briefly discussed in Chapter 4), which has much stronger\\ngradients than the Mean Squared Error, as you can see in Figure 15-10.\\nFigure 15-10.

The\\nmath is a bit more complex than earlier, in particular because of the Gaussian noise,\\nwhich limits the amount of information that can be transmitted to the coding layer\\n(thus pushing the autoencoder to learn useful features).

Salakhutdinov and G. Hinton (2008).\\n8. Let’s use a denoising autoencoder to pretrain an image classifier:\\n• Y ou can use MNIST (simplest), or another large set of images such as CIFAR10\\nif you want a bigger challenge. If you choose CIF\\nAR10, you need to write code\\nto load batches of images for training. If you want to skip this part, Tensor‐\\nFlow’s model zoo contains tools to do just that.\\n• Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. Train a deep denoising\\nautoencoder on the full training set.\\n• Check that the images are fairly well reconstructed, and visualize the low-level\\nfea\\ntures. Visualize the images tha\\nt most activate each neuron in the coding\\nlayer.\\n• Build a classification deep neural network, reusing the lower layers of the\\nautoencoder. T\\nrain it using only 10% of the training set. Can you get it to per‐\\nform as well as the same classifier trained on the full training set?\\n9. Semantic hashing, introduced in 2008 by Ruslan Salakh utdinov and Geoffrey\\nHinton,13 is a technique used for efficient information retrieval: a document (e.g.,\\nan image) is passed through a system, typically a neural network, which outputs a\\nfairly low-dimensional binary vector (e.g., 30 bits). Two similar documents are\\nlikely to have identical or very similar hashes. By indexing each document using\\nits hash, it is possible to retrieve many documents similar to a particular docu‐\\nment almost instantly, even if there are billions of documents: just compute the\\nhash of the document and look up all documents with that same hash (or hashes\\ndiffering by just one or two bits). Let’s implement semantic hashing using a\\nslightly tweaked stacked autoencoder:\\n• Create a stacked autoencoder containing two hidden layers below the coding\\nlayer, and train it on the image da\\ntaset you used in the previous exercise. The\\ncoding layer should contain 30 neurons and use the logistic activation function\\nto output values between 0 and 1. After training, to produce the hash of an\\nimage, you can simply run it through the autoencoder, take the output of the\\ncoding layer, and round every value to the closest integer (0 or 1).\\n• One neat trick proposed by Salakhutdinov and Hinton is to add Gaussian\\nnoise (with zero mean) to the inputs of the coding layer\\n, during training only.\\nIn order to preserve a high signal-to-noise ratio, the autoencoder will learn to\\nfeed large values to the coding layer (so that the noise becomes negligible). In\\nturn, this means that the logistic function of the coding layer will likely satu‐\\nrate at 0 or 1. As a result, rounding the codings to 0 or 1 won’t distort them too\\nmuch, and this will improve the reliability of the hashes.\\n434 | Chapter 15: Autoencoders\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

It has been around since the 1950s, producing many\\ninteresting applications over the years, 1 in particular in games (e.g., TD-Gammon, a\\nBackgammon playing program) and in machine control, but seldom making the\\nheadline news. But a revolution took place in 2013 when researchers from an English\\nstartup called DeepMind demonstrated a system that could learn to play just about\\nany Atari game from scratch, 2 eventually outperforming humans 3 in most of them,\\nusing only raw pixels as inputs and without any prior knowledge of the rules of the\\ngames.4 This was the first of a series of amazing feats, culminating in March 2016\\nwith the victory of their system AlphaGo against Lee Sedol, the world champion of\\nthe game of Go. No program had ever come close to beating a master of this game, let\\nalone the world champion. Today the whole field of RL is boiling with new ideas, with\\na wide range of applications. DeepMind was bought by Google for over 500 million\\ndollars in 2014.\\nSo how did they do it? With hindsight it seems rather simple: they applied the power\\nof Deep Learning to the field of Reinforcement Learning, and it worked beyond their\\nwildest dreams. In this chapter we will first explain what Reinforcement Learning is\\nand what it is good at, and then we will present two of the most important techniques\\nin deep Reinforcement Learning: policy gradients and deep Q-networks (DQN),\\n437\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

We will use these techni‐\\nques to train a model to balance a pole on a moving cart, and another to play Atari\\ngames. The same techniques can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from walking\\nrobots to self-driving cars.\\nLearning to Optimize Rewards\\nIn Reinforcement Learning, a software agent makes observations and takes actions\\nwithin an environment, and in return it receives rewards. Its objective is to learn to act\\nin a way that will maximize its expected long-term rewards. If you don’t mind a bit of\\nanthropomorphism, you can think of positive rewards as pleasure, and negative\\nrewards as pain (the term “reward” is a bit misleading in this case). In short, the agent\\nacts in the environment and learns by trial and error to maximize its pleasure and\\nminimize its pain.\\nThis is quite a broad setting, which can apply to a wide variety of tasks. Here are a few\\nexamples (see Figure 16-1):\\na. The agent can be the program controlling a walking robot. In this case, the envi‐\\nronment is the real world, the agen t obser\\nves the environment through a set of\\nsensors such as cameras and touch sensors, and its actions consist of sending sig‐\\nnals to activate motors. It may be programmed to get positive rewards whenever\\nit approaches the target destination, and negative rewards whenever it wastes\\ntime, goes in the wrong direction, or falls down.\\nb. The agent can be the program controlling Ms. Pac-Man. In this case, the environ‐\\nment is a sim ula\\ntion of the Atari game, the actions are the nine possible joystick\\npositions (upper left, down, center, and so on), the observations are screenshots,\\nand the rewards are just the game points.\\nc. Similarly, the agent can be the program playing a board game such as the game of\\nGo.\\nd. The agen\\nt does not have to control a physically (or virtually) moving thing. For\\nexample, it can be a smart thermostat, getting rewards whenever it is close to the\\ntarget tem\\nperature and saves energy, and negative rewards when humans need to\\ntweak the temperature, so the agent must learn to anticipate human needs.\\ne. The agent can observe stock market prices and decide how much to buy or sell\\nevery second. Rewards are obviously the monetary gains and losses.\\n438 \\n| Chapter 16: Reinforcement Learning\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Reinforcement Learning using a neural network policy\\nThe policy can be an y algorithm you can think of, and it does not even ha ve to be\\ndeterministic. F\\nor example, consider a robotic vacuum cleaner whose reward is the\\namount of dust it picks up in 30 minutes. Its policy could be to move forward with\\nsome probability p every second, or randomly rotate left or right with probability 1 –\\np. The rotation angle would be a random angle between –r and +r. Since this policy\\ninvolves some randomness, it is called a stochastic policy. The robot will have an\\nerratic trajectory, which guarantees that it will eventually get to any place it can reach\\nand pick up all the dust. The question is: how much dust will it pick up in 30\\nminutes?\\nHow would you train such a robot? There are just two policy parameters you can\\ntweak: the probability p and the angle range r. One possible learning algorithm could\\nbe to try out many different values for these parameters, and pick the combination\\nthat performs best (see Figure 16-3). This is an example of policy search, in this case\\nusing a brute force approach. However, when the policy space is too large (which is\\ngenerally the case), finding a good set of parameters this way is like searching for a\\nneedle in a gigantic haystack.\\nAnother way to explore the policy space is to use genetic algorithms. For example, you\\ncould randomly create a first generation of 100 policies and try them out, then “kill”\\nthe 80 worst policies 6 and make the 20 survivors produce 4 offspring each.

But how do we train it?\\nEvaluating Actions: The Credit Assignment Problem\\nIf we knew what the best action was at each step, we could train the neural network as\\nusual, by minimizing the cross entropy between the estimated probability and the tar‐\\nget probability. It would just be regular supervised learning. However, in Reinforce‐\\nment Learning the only guidance the agent gets is through rewards, and rewards are\\ntypically sparse and delayed. For example, if the agent manages to balance the pole\\nfor 100 steps, how can it know which of the 100 actions it took were good, and which\\nof them were bad? All it knows is that the pole fell after the last action, but surely this\\nlast action is not entirely responsible. This is called the credit assignment problem:\\nwhen the agent gets a reward, it is hard for it to know which actions should get credi‐\\nted (or blamed) for it. Think of a dog that gets rewarded hours after it behaved well;\\nwill it understand what it is rewarded for?\\nTo tackle this problem, a common strategy is to evaluate an action based on the sum\\nof all the rewards that come after it, usually applying a discount rate r at each step. For\\nexample (see Figure 16-6), if an agent decides to go right three times in a row and gets\\n+10 reward after the first step, 0 after the second step, and finally –50 after the third\\nstep, then assuming we use a discount rate r = 0.8, the first action will have a total\\nscore of 10 + r × 0 + r 2 × (–50) = –22. If the discount rate is close to 0, then future\\nrewards won’t count for much compared to immediate rewards. Conversely, if the \\ndiscount rate is close to 1, then rewards far into the future will count almost as much\\nas immediate rewards. Typical discount rates are 0.95 or 0.99. With a discount rate of\\n0.95, rewards 13 steps into the future count roughly for half as much as immediate\\nrewards (since 0.95 13 ≈ 0.5), while with a discount rate of 0.99, rewards 69 steps into\\nthe future count for half as much as immediate rewards. In the CartPole environ‐\\nment, actions have fairly short-term effects, so choosing a discount rate of 0.95 seems\\nreasonable.\\nEvaluating Actions: The Credit Assignment Problem | 447\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Since we are acting as though the chosen\\naction is the best possible action, the target probability must be 1.0 if the chosen\\naction is action 0 (left) and 0.0 if it is action 1 (right):\\ny = 1. - tf.to_float(action)\\nNow that we have a target probability, we can define the cost function (cross entropy) \\nand compute the gradients:\\nlearning_rate = 0.01\\ncross_entropy = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(\\n                    labels=y, logits=logits)\\noptimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate)\\ngrads_and_vars = optimizer.compute_gradients(cross_entropy)\\nNote that we are calling the optimizer’s compute_gradients() method instead of the\\nminimize() method. This is because we want to tweak the gradients before we apply\\nthem.10 The compute_gradients() method returns a list of gradient vector/variable\\npairs (one pair per trainable variable). Let’s put all the gradients in a list, to make it\\nmore convenient to obtain their values:\\ngradients = [grad for grad, variable in grads_and_vars]\\nOkay, now comes the tricky part. During the execution phase, the algorithm will run\\nthe policy and at each step it will evaluate these gradient tensors and store their val‐\\nues. After a number of episodes it will tweak these gradients as explained earlier (i.e.,\\nmultiply them by the action scores and normalize them) and compute the mean of\\nthe tweaked gradients. Next, it will need to feed the resulting gradients back to the\\nPolicy Gradients | 449\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Such a process has a fixed number of\\nstates, and it randomly evolves from one state to another at each step. The probability\\nfor it to evolve from a state s to a state s′ is fixed, and it depends only on the pair (s,s′),\\nnot on past states (the system has no memory).\\nFigure 16-7 shows an example of a Markov chain with four states. Suppose that the\\nprocess starts in state s 0, and there is a 70% chance that it will remain in that state at\\nthe next step. Eventually it is bound to leave that state and never come back since no\\nother state points back to s 0. If it goes to state s 1, it will then most likely go to state s 2\\n(90% probability), then immediately back to state s 1 (with 100% probability). It may\\nalternate a number of times between these two states, but eventually it will fall into\\nstate s3 and remain there forever (this is a terminal state). Markov chains can have\\nvery different dynamics, and they are heavily used in thermodynamics, chemistry,\\nstatistics, and much more.\\nMarkov Decision Processes | 453\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Bellman (1957).\\nFigure 16-7. Example of a Markov chain\\nMarkov decision processes were first described in the 1950s by Richard B\\nellman.11\\nThey resemble Markov chains but with a twist: at each step, an agent can choose one\\nof several possible actions, and the transition probabilities depend on the chosen\\naction. Moreover, some state transitions return some reward (positive or negative),\\nand the agent’s goal is to find a policy that will maximize rewards over time.\\nFor example, the MDP represented in Figure 16-8 has three states and up to three\\npossible discrete actions at each step. If it starts in state s 0, the agent can choose\\nbetween actions a0, a1, or a2. If it chooses action a1, it just remains in state s0 with cer‐\\ntainty, and without any reward. It can thus decide to stay there forever if it wants. But\\nif it chooses action a 0, it has a 70% probability of gaining a reward of +10, and\\nremaining in state s0. It can then try again and again to gain as much reward as possi‐\\nble. But at one point it is going to end up instead in state s 1. In state s1 it has only two\\npossible actions: a0 or a1. It can choose to stay put by repeatedly choosing action a1, or\\nit can choose to move on to state s2 and get a negative reward of –50 (ouch). In state s3\\nit has no other choice than to take action a 1, which will most likely lead it back to\\nstate s0, gaining a reward of +40 on the way. Y ou get the picture. By looking at this\\nMDP , can you guess which strategy will gain the most reward over time? In state s 0 it\\nis clear that action a 0 is the best option, and in state s 3 the agent has no choice but to\\ntake action a1, but in state s1 it is not obvious whether the agent should stay put (a0) or\\ngo through the fire (a2).\\n454 | Chapter 16: Reinforcement Learning\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

It is somewhat surprising tha\\nt this algorithm is capable of learning the opti‐\\nmal policy by just watching an agent act randomly (imagine learning to play golf\\nwhen your teacher is a drunken monkey). Can we do better?\\nExploration Policies\\nOf course Q-Learning can work only if the exploration policy explores the MDP\\nthoroughly enough. Although a purely random policy is guaranteed to eventually\\nvisit every state and every transition many times, it may take an extremely long time\\nto do so. Therefore, a better option is to use the ε-greedy policy: at each step it acts\\nrandomly with probability ε, or greedily (choosing the action with the highest Q-\\nValue) with probability 1-ε. The advantage of the ε-greedy policy (compared to a\\ncompletely random policy) is that it will spend more and more time exploring the\\ninteresting parts of the environment, as the Q-Value estimates get better and better,\\nwhile still spending some time visiting unknown regions of the MDP . It is quite com‐\\nmon to start with a high value for ε ( e.g., 1.0) and then gradually reduce it (e.g., down\\nto 0.05).\\nAlternatively, rather than relying on chance for exploration, another approach is to\\nencourage the exploration policy to try actions that it has not tried much before. This\\ncan be implemented as a bonus added to the Q-Value estimates, as shown in Equation\\n16-6.\\nTemporal Difference Learning and Q-Learning | 459\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Consider trying to use Q-Learning to\\ntrain an agent to play Ms. Pac-Man. There are over 250 pellets that Ms. Pac-Man can\\neat, each of which can be present or absent (i.e., already eaten). So the number of pos‐\\nsible states is greater than 2250 ≈ 1075 (and that’s considering the possible states only of\\nthe pellets). This is way more than atoms in the observable universe, so there’s abso‐\\nlutely no way you can keep track of an estimate for every single Q-Value.\\nThe solution is to find a function that approximates the Q-Values using a manageable\\nnumber of parameters. This is called Approximate Q-Learning. For years it was rec‐\\nommended to use linear combinations of hand-crafted features extracted from the\\nstate (e.g., distance of the closest ghosts, their directions, and so on) to estimate Q-\\nValues, but DeepMind showed that using deep neural networks can work much bet‐\\nter, especially for complex problems, and it does not require any feature engineering.\\nA DNN used to estimate Q-Values is called a deep Q-network (DQN), and using a\\nDQN for Approximate Q-Learning is called Deep Q-Learning.\\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will use Deep Q-Learning to train an agent to play Ms.\\nPac-Man, much like DeepMind did in 2013. The code can easily be tweaked to learn\\nto play the majority of Atari games quite well. It can achieve superhuman skill at most\\naction games, but it is not so good at games with long-running storylines.\\nLearning to Play Ms. Pac-Man Using Deep Q-Learning\\nSince we will be using an Atari environment, we must first install OpenAI gym’s Atari\\ndependencies.

Plus we have an operation\\ncalled copy_critic_to_actor to copy all the trainable variables of the critic DQN to\\nthe actor DQN. We use TensorFlow’s tf.group() function to group all the assign‐\\nment operations into a single convenient operation.\\nThe actor DQN can be used to play Ms. Pac-Man (initially very badly).

How will it learn to play the game? The short answer\\nis that it will try to make its Q-Value predictions match the Q-Values estimated by the\\nactor through its experience of the game. Specifically, we will let the actor play for a\\nwhile, storing all its experiences in a replay memory. Each memory will be a 5-tuple\\n(state, action, next state, reward, continue), where the “continue” item will be equal to\\n0.0 when the game is over, or 1.0 otherwise.

Spam detection is a typical super\\nvised learning problem: the algorithm is fed\\nmany emails along with their label (spam or not spam).\\n9. An online learning system can learn incrementally\\n, as opposed to a batch learn‐\\ning system. This makes it capable of adapting ra\\npidly to both changing data and\\nautonomous systems, and of training on very large quantities of data.\\n10. Out-of-core algorithms can handle vast quantities of data that cannot fit in a\\ncomputer’s main memor\\ny. An out-of-core learning algorithm chops the data into\\nmini-batches and uses online learning techniques to learn from these mini-\\nbatches.\\n11. An instance-based learning system learns the training data by heart; then, when\\ngiven a new instance, it uses a similarity measure to find the most similar learned\\ninstances and uses them to make predictions.\\n12. A model has one or more model parameters that determine what it will predict\\ngiven a new instance (e.g., the slope of a linear model). A learning algorithm tries\\nto find optimal values for these parameters such that the model generalizes well\\nto new instances. A hyperparameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm\\nitself, not of the model (e.g., the amoun\\nt of regularization to apply).\\n13. Model-based learning algorithms search for an optimal value for the model\\nparameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances. W e usually\\ntrain such systems by minimizing a cost function tha\\nt measures how bad the sys‐\\ntem is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model com‐\\nplexity if the model is regularized. To make predictions, we feed the new\\ninstance’s features into the model’s prediction function, using the parameter val‐\\nues found by the learning algorithm.\\n14. Some of the main challenges in Machine Learning are the lack of data, poor data\\nquality, nonrepresenta\\ntive data, uninformative features, excessively simple mod‐\\nels that underfit the training data, and excessively complex models that overfit\\nthe data.\\n15. If a model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new\\ninstances, the model is likely overfitting the training data (or we got extremely\\nlucky on the training data). P\\nossible solutions to overfitting are getting more\\ndata, simplifying the model (selecting a simpler algorithm, reducing the number\\nof parameters or features used, or regularizing the model), or reducing the noise\\nin the training data.\\n16.

The fundamental idea behind Support Vector Machines is to fit the widest possi‐\\nble “street” between the classes. In other words, the goal is to ha\\nve the largest pos‐\\nsible margin between the decision boundary that separates the two classes and\\nthe training instances. When performing soft margin classification, the SVM\\nsearches for a compromise between perfectly separating the two classes and hav‐\\ning the widest possible street (i.e., a few instances may end up on the street).\\nAnother key idea is to use kernels when training on nonlinear datasets.\\n2. After training an SVM, a sup port vector is any instance located on the “street” (see\\nthe previous answer), including its border. The decision boundary is entirely\\ndetermined by the support vectors. Any instance that is not a support vector (i.e.,\\noff the street) has no influence whatsoever; you could remove them, add more\\ninstances, or move them around, and as long as they stay off the street they won’t\\naffect the decision boundary. Computing the predictions only involves the sup‐\\nport vectors, not the whole training set.\\n3. SVMs try to fit the largest possible “street” between the classes (see the first\\nanswer), so if the training set is not scaled, the SVM will tend to neglect small\\nfeatures (see Figure 5-2\\n).\\n4. An SVM classifier can output the distance between the test instance and the deci‐\\nsion boundary, and you can use this as a confidence score. H\\nowever, this score\\ncannot be directly converted into an estimation of the class probability. If you set\\nprobability=True when creating an SVM in Scikit-Learn, then after training it\\nwill calibrate the probabilities using Logistic Regression on the SVM’s scores\\n(trained by an additional five-fold cross-validation on the training data). This\\nwill add the predict_proba() and predict_log_proba() methods to the SVM.\\nExercise Solutions | 475\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

So\\nif you multiply the training set size by 10, the training time will be multiplied by\\nK = (n × 10m × log(10m)) / (n × m × log(m)) = 10 × log(10m) / log(m). If m =\\n106, then K ≈ 11.7, so you can expect the training time to be roughly 11.7 hours.\\n6. Presorting the training set speeds up training only if the dataset is smaller than a\\nfew thousand instances. If it contains 100,000 instances, setting presort=True\\nwill considerably slow down training.\\nF\\nor the solutions to exercises 7 and 8, please see the Jupyter notebooks available at\\nhttps://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.\\nChapter 7: Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\\n1.

A hard voting classifier just counts the votes of each classifier in the ensemble\\nand picks the class tha t gets the most votes. A soft voting classifier com putes the\\na\\nverage estimated class probability for each class and picks the class with the\\nhighest probability. This gives high-confidence votes more weight and often per‐\\nforms better, but it works only if every classifier is able to estimate class probabil‐\\nities (e.g., for the SVM classifiers in Scikit-Learn you must set\\nprobability=True).\\n3. It is quite possible to speed up training of a bagging ensemble by distributing it\\nacross multiple ser vers, since each predictor in the ensemble is independen\\nt of\\nthe others. The same goes for pasting ensembles and Random Forests, for the\\nsame reason. However, each predictor in a boosting ensemble is built based on\\nthe previous predictor, so training is necessarily sequential, and you will not gain\\nanything by distributing training across multiple servers. Regarding stacking\\nensembles, all the predictors in a given layer are independent of each other, so\\nthey can be trained in parallel on multiple servers. However, the predictors in one\\nlayer can only be trained after the predictors in the previous layer have all been\\ntrained.\\n4. With out-of-bag evaluation, each predictor in a bagging ensemble is evaluated\\nusing instances that it was not trained on (they were held out). This makes it pos‐\\nsible to have a fairly unbiased evalua\\ntion of the ensemble without the need for an\\nadditional validation set. Thus, you have more instances available for training,\\nand your ensemble can perform slightly better.\\n5. When you are growing a tree in a Random Forest, only a random subset of the\\nfeatures is considered for splitting at each node. This is true as well for Extra-\\nT\\nrees, but they go one step further: rather than searching for the best possible\\nthresholds, like regular Decision Trees do, they use random thresholds for each\\nfeature. This extra randomness acts like a form of regularization: if a Random\\nForest overfits the training data, Extra-Trees might perform better. Moreover,\\nsince Extra-Trees don’t search for the best possible thresholds, they are much\\nfaster to train than Random Forests. However, they are neither faster nor slower\\nthan Random Forests when making predictions.\\n6.

The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that many problems that do not\\nexist in low-dimensional space arise in high-dimensional space. In Machine\\nLearning, one common manifestation is the fact tha\\nt randomly sampled high-\\ndimensional vectors are generally very sparse, increasing the risk of overfitting\\nand making it very difficult to identify patterns in the data without having plenty\\nof training data.\\n3. Once a dataset’s dimensionality has been reduced using one of the algorithms we\\ndiscussed, it is almost always im possible to perfectly reverse the opera\\ntion,\\nbecause some information gets lost during dimensionality reduction. Moreover,\\nwhile some algorithms (such as PCA) have a simple reverse transformation pro‐\\ncedure that can reconstruct a dataset relatively similar to the original, other algo‐\\nrithms (such as T-SNE) do not.\\n4. PCA can be used to significantly reduce the dimensionality of most datasets, even\\nif they are highly nonlinear, because it can a\\nt least get rid of useless dimensions.\\nHowever, if there are no useless dimensions—for example, the Swiss roll—then\\nreducing dimensionality with PCA will lose too much information. Y ou want to\\nunroll the Swiss roll, not squash it.\\n5. That’s a trick question: it depends on the dataset. Let’s look at two extreme exam‐\\nples. First, suppose the dataset is composed of poin\\nts that are almost perfectly\\naligned. In this case, PCA can reduce the dataset down to just one dimension\\nwhile still preserving 95% of the variance.

Regular PCA is the default, but it works only if the dataset fits in memory. Incre‐\\nmental PCA is useful for large datasets tha\\nt don’t fit in memory, but it is slower\\nthan regular PCA, so if the dataset fits in memory you should prefer regular\\nPCA.

Intuitively, a dimensionality reduction algorithm performs well if it eliminates a\\nlot of dimensions from the dataset without losing too much informa\\ntion. One\\nway to measure this is to apply the reverse transformation and measure the\\nreconstruction error. However, not all dimensionality reduction algorithms pro‐\\nvide a reverse transformation. Alternatively, if you are using dimensionality\\nreduction as a preprocessing step before another Machine Learning algorithm\\n(e.g., a Random Forest classifier), then you can simply measure the performance\\nof that second algorithm; if dimensionality reduction did not lose too much\\ninformation, then the algorithm should perform just as well as when using the\\noriginal dataset.\\n8. It can absolutely make sense to chain two different dimensionality reduction\\nalgorithms. A common example is using PCA to quickly get rid of a large n um‐\\nber of useless dimensions, then a\\npplying another much slower dimensionality\\nreduction algorithm, such as LLE.

Backpropagation is a technique used to train artificial neural networks. It first\\ncomputes the gradients of the cost function with regards to ever\\ny model parame‐\\nter (all the weights and biases), and then it performs a Gradient Descent step\\nusing these gradients. This backpropagation step is typically performed thou‐\\nsands or millions of times, using many training batches, until the model parame‐\\nters converge to values that (hopefully) minimize the cost function. To compute\\nthe gradients, backpropagation uses reverse-mode autodiff (although it wasn’t\\ncalled that when backpropagation was invented, and it has been reinvented sev‐\\neral times). Reverse-mode autodiff performs a forward pass through a computa‐\\ntion graph, computing every node’s value for the current training batch, and then\\nit performs a reverse pass, computing all the gradients at once (see Appendix D\\nfor more details). So what’s the difference? Well, backpropagation refers to the\\nwhole process of training an artificial neural network using multiple backpropa‐\\ngation steps, each of which computes gradients and uses them to perform a Gra‐\\ndient Descent step. In contrast, reverse-mode autodiff is a simply a technique to\\ncompute gradients efficiently, and it happens to be used by backpropagation.\\n484 | Appendix A: Exercise Solutions\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

No, all weights should be sampled independently; they should not all have the\\nsame initial value. One importan t goal of sam\\npling weights randomly is to break\\nsymmetries: if all the weights have the same initial value, even if that value is not\\nzero, then symmetry is not broken (i.e., all neurons in a given layer are equiva‐\\nlent), and backpropagation will be unable to break it. Concretely, this means that\\nall the neurons in any given layer will always have the same weights. It’s like hav‐\\ning just one neuron per layer, and much slower. It is virtually impossible for such\\na configuration to converge to a good solution.\\n2. It is perfectly fine to initialize the bias terms to zero. Some people like to initialize\\nthem just like weights, and that\\n’s okay too; it does not make much difference.\\n3. A few advantages of the ELU function over the ReLU function are:\\n• It can take on negative values, so the average output of the neurons in any\\ngiven layer is typically closer to 0 than when using the ReL U activa\\ntion func‐\\ntion (which never outputs negative values). This helps alleviate the vanishing\\ngradients problem.\\n• It always has a nonzero derivative, which avoids the dying units issue that can\\naffect ReLU units.\\nExercise Solutions | \\n485\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Such an abrupt change can slow down Gradient Descent because it\\nwill bounce around z = 0.\\n4. The ELU activation function is a good default. If you need the neural network to\\nbe as fast as possible, you can use one of the leaky ReLU variants instead (e.g., a\\nsim\\nple leaky ReLU using the default hyperparameter value). The simplicity of the\\nReLU activation function makes it many people’s preferred option, despite the\\nfact that they are generally outperformed by the ELU and leaky ReLU. However,\\nthe ReLU activation function’s capability of outputting precisely zero can be use‐\\nful in some cases (e.g., see Chapter 15). The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) can be use‐\\nful in the output layer if you need to output a number between –1 and 1, but\\nnowadays it is not used much in hidden layers. The logistic activation function is\\nalso useful in the output layer when you need to estimate a probability (e.g., for\\nbinary classification), but it is also rarely used in hidden layers (there are excep‐\\ntions—for example, for the coding layer of variational autoencoders; see Chap‐\\nter 15). Finally, the softmax activation function is useful in the output layer to\\noutput probabilities for mutually exclusive classes, but other than that it is rarely\\n(if ever) used in hidden layers.\\n5. If you set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using\\na MomentumOptimizer, then the algorithm will likely pick up a lot of speed, hope‐\\nfully roughly toward the global minim\\num, but then it will shoot right past the\\nminimum, due to its momentum.

To fix this problem, a triv‐\\nial solution is to stop the other processes and try again. However, if you need all\\nprocesses to run simultaneously, a simple option is to dedicate different devices\\nto each process, by setting the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable\\nappropriately for each device. Another option is to configure TensorFlow to grab\\nonly part of the GPU memory, instead of all of it, by creating a ConfigProto, set‐\\nting its gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction to the proportion of\\nthe total memory that it should grab (e.g., 0.4), and using this ConfigProto when\\nopening a session. The last option is to tell TensorFlow to grab memory only\\nwhen it needs it by setting the gpu_options.allow_growth to True. However,\\nthis last option is usually not recommended because any memory that Tensor‐\\nFlow grabs is never released, and it is harder to guarantee a repeatable behavior\\n(there may be race conditions depending on which processes start first, how\\nmuch memory they need during training, and so on).\\n2. By pinning an operation on a device, you are telling TensorFlow that this is\\nwhere you would like this operation to be placed.

Another example\\nis an operation tha\\nt can modify a variable; this operation and the variable need to\\nbe collocated.

If you are running on a GPU-enabled TensorFlow installation, and you just use\\nthe default placement, then if all opera\\ntions have a GPU kernel (i.e., a GPU\\nimplementation), yes, they will all be placed on the first GPU.

A CNN’s architecture embeds this prior\\nknowledge. Lower la\\nyers typically identify features in small areas of the images,\\nwhile higher layers combine the lower-level features into larger features. This\\nworks well with most natural images, giving CNNs a decisive head start com‐\\npared to DNNs.\\n2. Let’s compute how many parameters the CNN has. Since its first convolutional\\nlayer has 3 × 3 kernels, and the input has three channels (red, green, and blue),\\nthen each fea\\nture map has 3 × 3 × 3 weights, plus a bias term. That’s 28 parame‐\\nters per feature map. Since this first convolutional layer has 100 feature maps, it\\nhas a total of 2,800 parameters. The second convolutional layer has 3 × 3 kernels,\\nand its input is the set of 100 feature maps of the previous layer, so each feature\\nmap has 3 × 3 × 100 = 900 weights, plus a bias term. Since it has 200 feature\\nmaps, this layer has 901 × 200 = 180,200 parameters.

Since it has 400 feature maps, this layer has a total of 1,801 × 400\\n= 720,400 parameters. All in all, the CNN has 2,800 + 180,200 + 720,400 =\\n903,400 parameters.\\nNow let’s compute how much RAM this neural network will require (at least)\\nwhen making a prediction for a single instance. First let’s compute the feature\\nmap size for each layer. Since we are using a stride of 2 and SAME padding, the\\nhorizontal and vertical size of the feature maps are divided by 2 at each layer\\n(rounding up if necessary), so as the input channels are 200 × 300 pixels, the first\\nlayer’s feature maps are 100 × 150, the second layer’s feature maps are 50 × 75,\\nand the third layer’s feature maps are 25 × 38. Since 32 bits is 4 bytes and the first\\nconvolutional layer has 100 feature maps, this first layer takes up 4 x 100 × 150 ×\\n100 = 6 million bytes (about 5.7 MB, considering that 1 MB = 1,024 KB and 1 KB\\n= 1,024 bytes). The second layer takes up 4 × 50 × 75 × 200 = 3 million bytes\\n(about 2.9 MB). Finally, the third layer takes up 4 × 25 × 38 × 400 = 1,520,000\\nbytes (about 1.4 MB). However, once a layer has been computed, the memory\\noccupied by the previous layer can be released, so if everything is well optimized,\\nonly 6 + 9 = 15 million bytes (about 14.3 MB) of RAM will be required (when the\\nsecond layer has just been computed, but the memory occupied by the first layer\\nis not released yet). But wait, you also need to add the memory occupied by the\\nCNN’s parameters. We computed earlier that it has 903,400 parameters, each\\nusing up 4 bytes, so this adds 3,613,600 bytes (about 3.4 MB).

To classify videos based on the visual content, one possible architecture could be\\nto take (say) one frame per second, then run each frame through a con volutional\\nneural network, feed the output of the CNN to a sequence-to-vector RNN, and\\nfinally run its output through a softmax la\\nyer, giving you all the class probabili‐\\nties. For training you would just use cross entropy as the cost function. If you\\nwanted to use the audio for classification as well, you could convert every second\\nof audio to a spectrograph, feed this spectrograph to a CNN, and feed the output\\nof this CNN to the RNN (along with the corresponding output of the other\\nCNN).\\n4.

The fact that an autoencoder perfectly reconstructs its inputs does not necessarily\\nmean that it is a good a utoencoder\\n; perhaps it is simply an overcomplete autoen‐\\ncoder that learned to copy its inputs to the codings layer and then to the outputs.\\nIn fact, even if the codings layer contained a single neuron, it would be possible\\nfor a very deep autoencoder to learn to map each training instance to a different\\ncoding (e.g., the first instance could be mapped to 0.001, the second to 0.002, the\\nthird to 0.003, and so on), and it could learn “by heart” to reconstruct the right\\ntraining instance for each coding. It would perfectly reconstruct its inputs\\nwithout really learning any useful pattern in the data. In practice such a mapping\\nis unlikely to happen, but it illustrates the fact that perfect reconstructions are not\\na guarantee that the autoencoder learned anything useful. However, if it produces\\nvery bad reconstructions, then it is almost guaranteed to be a bad autoencoder.\\nTo evaluate the performance of an autoencoder, one option is to measure the\\nreconstruction loss (e.g., compute the MSE, the mean square of the outputs\\nminus the inputs). Again, a high reconstruction loss is a good sign that the\\nautoencoder is bad, but a low reconstruction loss is not a guarantee that it is\\ngood. Y ou should also evaluate the autoencoder according to what it will be used\\nfor. For example, if you are using it for unsupervised pretraining of a classifier,\\nthen you should also evaluate the classifier’s performance.\\n4. An undercomplete autoencoder is one whose codings layer is smaller than the\\ninput and output layers. If it is larger\\n, then it is an overcomplete autoencoder.\\nThe main risk of an excessively undercomplete autoencoder is that it may fail to\\nreconstruct the inputs. The main risk of an overcomplete autoencoder is that it\\nmay just copy the inputs to the outputs, without learning any useful feature.\\n5. To tie the weights of an encoder layer and its corresponding decoder layer, you\\nsimply make the decoder weigh ts equal to the transpose of the encoder weigh\\nts.\\nThis reduces the number of parameters in the model by half, often making train‐\\ning converge faster with less training data, and reducing the risk of overfitting the\\ntraining set.\\n6. To visualize the features learned by the lower layer of a stacked autoencoder, a\\ncommon technique is simply to plot the weights of each neuron, by resha\\nping\\neach weight vector to the size of an input image (e.g., for MNIST, reshaping a\\nweight vector of shape [784] to [28, 28]). To visualize the features learned by\\nhigher layers, one technique is to display the training instances that most activate\\neach neuron.\\n7. A generative model is a model capable of randomly generating outputs that\\nresemble the training instances. For exam ple, once trained successfully on the\\nMNIST da\\ntaset, a generative model can be used to randomly generate realistic\\nimages of digits. The output distribution is typically similar to the training data.\\nFor example, since MNIST contains many images of each digit, the generative\\nmodel would output roughly the same number of images of each digit.

Reinforcement Learning is an area of Machine Learning aimed at creating agents\\ncapable of taking actions in an en vironmen\\nt in a way that maximizes rewards\\nover time. There are many differences between RL and regular supervised and\\nunsupervised learning. Here are a few:\\n• In supervised and unsupervised learning, the goal is generally to find patterns\\nin the data. In Reinforcement Learning, the goal is to find a good policy\\n.\\n• Unlike in supervised learning, the agent is not explicitly given the “right”\\nanswer. It m\\nust learn by trial and error.\\n• Unlike in unsupervised learning, there is a form of supervision, through\\nrewards. We do not tell the agent how to perform the task, but we do tell it\\nwhen it is making progress or when it is failing.\\n• A Reinforcemen\\nt Learning agent needs to find the right balance between\\nexploring the environmen t, looking for new wa\\nys of getting rewards, and\\nexploiting sources of rewards that it already knows. In contrast, supervised and\\nunsupervised learning systems generally don’t need to worry about explora‐\\ntion; they just feed on the training data they are given.\\n• In supervised and unsupervised learning, training instances are typically inde‐\\npendent (in fact, they are generally shuffled). In Reinforcemen\\nt Learning, con‐\\nsecutive observations are generally not independent. An agent may remain in\\nthe same region of the environment for a while before it moves on, so consecu‐\\ntive observations will be very correlated. In some cases a replay memory is\\nused to ensure that the training algorithm gets fairly independent observa‐\\ntions.\\n2. Here are a few possible applications of Reinforcement Learning, other than those\\nmentioned in Cha\\npter 16:\\nMusic personalization\\nThe environment is a user’s personalized web radio. The agent is the software\\ndeciding what song to play next for that user. Its possible actions are to play\\nany song in the catalog (it must try to choose a song the user will enjoy) or to\\nplay an advertisement (it must try to choose an ad that the user will be inter‐\\n494 | Appendix A: Exercise Solutions\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

It gets a small reward every time the user listens to a song, a larger\\nreward every time the user listens to an ad, a nega tive reward when the user\\nskips a song or an ad, and a ver\\ny negative reward if the user leaves.\\nMarketing\\nThe environment is your company’s marketing department. The agent is the\\nsoftware that defines which customers a mailing campaign should be sent to,\\ngiven their profile and purchase history (for each customer it has two possi‐\\nble actions: send or don’t send). It gets a negative reward for the cost of the\\nmailing campaign, and a positive reward for estimated revenue generated\\nfrom this campaign.\\nProduct delivery\\nLet the agent control a fleet of delivery trucks, deciding what they should\\npick up at the depots, where they should go, what they should drop off, and\\nso on. They would get positive rewards for each product delivered on time,\\nand negative rewards for late deliveries.\\n3. When estimating the value of an action, Reinforcement Learning algorithms typ‐\\nically sum all the rewards that this action led to, giving more weigh\\nt to immediate\\nrewards, and less weight to later rewards (considering that an action has more\\ninfluence on the near future than on the distant future). To model this, a discount\\nrate is typically applied at each time step. For example, with a discount rate of 0.9,\\na reward of 100 that is received two time steps later is counted as only 0.9 2 × 100\\n= 81 when you are estimating the value of the action. Y ou can think of the dis‐\\ncount rate as a measure of how much the future is valued relative to the present:\\nif it is very close to 1, then the future is valued almost as much as the present. If it\\nis close to 0, then only immediate rewards matter. Of course, this impacts the\\noptimal policy tremendously: if you value the future, you may be willing to put\\nup with a lot of immediate pain for the prospect of eventual rewards, while if you\\ndon’t value the future, you will just grab any immediate reward you can find,\\nnever investing in the future.\\n4. To measure the performance of a Reinforcement Learning agent, you can simply\\nsum up the rewards it gets. In a simula ted en\\nvironment, you can run many epi‐\\nsodes and look at the total rewards it gets on average (and possibly look at the\\nmin, max, standard deviation, and so on).\\n5. The credit assignment problem is the fact that when a Reinforcement Learning\\nagent receives a reward, it has no direct way of knowing which of its previous\\nactions con\\ntributed to this reward. It typically occurs when there is a large delay\\nbetween an action and the resulting rewards (e.g., during a game of Atari’s Pong,\\nthere may be a few dozen time steps between the moment the agent hits the ball\\nand the moment it wins the point). One way to alleviate it is to provide the agent\\nwith shorter-term rewards, when possible. This usually requires prior knowledge\\nExercise Solutions | 495\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

An agent can often remain in the same region of its environment for a while, so\\nall of its experiences will be very similar for that period of time. This can in\\ntro‐\\nduce some bias in the learning algorithm. It may tune its policy for this region of\\nthe environment, but it will not perform well as soon as it moves out of this\\nregion. To solve this problem, you can use a replay memory; instead of using\\nonly the most immediate experiences for learning, the agent will learn based on a\\nbuffer of its past experiences, recent and not so recent (perhaps this is why we\\ndream at night: to replay our experiences of the day and better learn from them?).\\n7. An off-policy RL algorithm learns the value of the optimal policy (i.e., the sum of\\ndiscounted rewards that can be expected for each sta\\nte if the agent acts opti‐\\nmally), independently of how the agent actually acts. Q-Learning is a good exam‐\\nple of such an algorithm. In contrast, an on-policy algorithm learns the value of\\nthe policy that the agent actually executes, including both exploration and exploi‐\\ntation.\\nFor the solutions to exercises 8, 9, and 10, please see the Jupyter notebooks available\\nat https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.\\n496 | Appendix A: Exercise Solutions\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Let’s look at a\\nsimple example. Suppose you want to find the values of x and y that minimize the\\nfunction f(x,y) = x 2 + 2y, subject to an equality constraint: 3x + 2y + 1 = 0. Using the\\nLagrange multipliers method, we start by defining a new function called the Lagran‐\\ngian (or Lagrange function): g(x, y, α) = f(x, y) – α(3x + 2y + 1). Each constraint (in\\nthis case just one) is subtracted from the original objective, multiplied by a new vari‐\\nable called a Lagrange multiplier.\\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange showed that if x, y  is a solution to the constrained optimiza‐\\ntion problem, then there must exist an α such that x, y, α  is a stationary point of the\\nLagrangian (a sta\\ntionary point is a point where all partial derivatives are equal to\\nzero). In other words, we can compute the partial derivatives of g(x, y, α) with regards\\nto x, y, and α; we can find the points where these derivatives are all equal to zero; and\\nthe solutions to the constrained optimization problem (if they exist) must be among\\nthese stationary points.\\nIn this example the partial derivatives are: \\n∂\\n∂x g x, y, α = 2x − 3α\\n∂\\n∂y g x, y, α = 2 − 2α\\n∂\\n∂α g x, y, α = − 3x − 2y − 1\\nWhen all these partial deriva\\ntives are equal to 0, we find that\\n2x − 3α = 2 − 2α = − 3x − 2y − 1 = 0, from which we can easily find that x = 3\\n2 ,\\ny = − 11\\n4 , and α = 1. This is the only stationary point, and as it respects the con‐\\nstraint, it must be the solution to the constrained optimization problem.\\n503\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

The generalized\\nLagrangian for the hard margin problem is given by Equation C-1, where the α(i) vari‐\\nables are called the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) multipliers, and they must be greater\\nor equal to zero.\\nEquation C-1.

At each iteration, the\\nenergy decreases, so the network is guaranteed to eventually stabilize to a low-energy\\nstate. The training algorithm tweaks the weights in a way that decreases the energy\\nlevel of the training patterns, so the network is likely to stabilize in one of these low-\\nenergy configurations. Unfortunately, some patterns that were not in the training set\\nalso end up with low energy, so the network sometimes stabilizes in a configuration\\nthat was not learned.

For example, if there are\\nthree visible neurons and the training set contains 75% (0, 1, 1) triplets, 10% (0, 0, 1)\\ntriplets, and 15% (1, 1, 1) triplets, then after training a Boltzmann machine, you could\\nuse it to generate random binary triplets with about the same probability distribu‐\\ntion. For example, about 75% of the time it would output the (0, 1, 1) triplet.\\nSuch a generative model can be used in a variety of ways. For example, if it is trained\\non images, and you provide an incomplete or noisy image to the network, it will\\nautomatically “repair” the image in a reasonable way. Y ou can also use a generative\\nmodel for classification. Just add a few visible neurons to encode the training image’s\\nclass (e.g., add 10 visible neurons and turn on only the fifth neuron when the training\\nimage represents a 5). Then, when given a new image, the network will automatically\\nturn on the appropriate visible neurons, indicating the image’s class (e.g., it will turn\\non the fifth visible neuron if the image represents a 5).\\nUnfortunately, there is no efficient technique to train Boltzmann machines. However,\\nfairly efficient algorithms have been developed to train restricted Boltzmann machines\\n(RBM).\\nRestricted Boltzmann Machines\\nAn RBM is simply a Boltzmann machine in which there are no connections between\\nvisible units or between hidden units, only between visible and hidden units. For\\nexample, Figure E-3 represents an RBM with three visible units and four hidden\\nunits.\\n518 | Appendix E: Other Popular ANN Architectures\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

Carreira-Perpiñán and Geoffrey Hinton.1 Here is how it works: for\\neach training instance x, the algorithm starts by feeding it to the network by setting\\nthe state of the visible units to x1, x2, ⋯, xn. Then you compute the state of the hidden\\nunits by applying the stochastic equation described before (Equation E-1). This gives\\nyou a hidden vector h (where hi is equal to the state of the ith unit). Next you compute\\nthe state of the visible units, by applying the same stochastic equation. This gives you\\na vector \\ud835˙. Then once again you compute the state of the hidden units, which gives\\nyou a vector \\ud835˙. Now you can update each connection weight by applying the rule in\\nEquation E-2.\\nEquation E-2.

This makes it incomparably more efficient than previous algorithms, and it\\nwas a key ingredient to the first success of Deep Learning based on multiple stacked\\nRBMs.\\nDeep Belief Nets\\nSeveral layers of RBMs can be stacked; the hidden units of the first-level RBM serves\\nas the visible units for the second-layer RBM, and so on. Such an RBM stack is called\\na deep belief net (DBN).\\nY ee-Whye Teh, one of Geoffrey Hinton’s students, observed that it was possible to\\ntrain DBNs one layer at a time using Contrastive Divergence, starting with the lower\\nOther Popular ANN Architectures | 519\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

This led to the groundbreaking\\narticle that kickstarted the Deep Learning tsunami in 2006.2\\nJ\\nust like RBMs, DBNs learn to reproduce the probability distribution of their inputs,\\nwithout any supervision. However, they are much better at it, for the same reason that\\ndeep neural networks are more powerful than shallow ones: real-world data is often\\norganized in hierarchical patterns, and DBNs take advantage of that. Their lower lay‐\\ners learn low-level features in the input data, while higher layers learn high-level fea‐\\ntures.\\nJust like RBMs, DBNs are fundamentally unsupervised, but you can also train them\\nin a supervised manner by adding some visible units to represent the labels. More‐\\nover, one great feature of DBNs is that they can be trained in a semisupervised fash‐\\nion. Figure E-4 represents such a DBN configured for semisupervised learning.\\nFigure E-4.

Several more RBMs could\\nbe stacked this way, but you get the idea. So far, training was 100% unsupervised.\\n520 | Appendix E: Other Popular ANN Architectures\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m'),\n",

I\\nt learns to associate high-level features with training labels. This is\\nthe supervised step.\\nAt the end of training, if you feed RBM 1 a new instance, the signal will propagate up\\nto RBM 2, then up to the top of RBM 3, and then back down to the label units; hope‐\\nfully, the appropriate label will light up. This is how a DBN can be used for classifica‐\\ntion.\\nOne great benefit of this semisupervised approach is that you don’t need much\\nlabeled training data. If the unsupervised RBMs do a good enough job, then only a\\nsmall amount of labeled training instances per class will be necessary. Similarly, a\\nbaby learns to recognize objects without supervision, so when you point to a chair\\nand say “chair, ” the baby can associate the word “chair” with the class of objects it has\\nalready learned to recognize on its own. Y ou don’t need to point to every single chair\\nand say “chair”; only a few examples will suffice (just enough so the baby can be sure\\nthat you are indeed referring to the chair, not to its color or one of the chair’s parts).\\nQuite amazingly, DBNs can also work in reverse. If you activate one of the label units,\\nthe signal will propagate up to the hidden units of RBM 3, then down to RBM 2, and\\nthen RBM 1, and a new instance will be output by the visible units of RBM 1. This\\nnew instance will usually look like a regular instance of the class whose label unit you\\nactivated. This generative capability of DBNs is quite powerful. For example, it has\\nbeen used to automatically generate captions for images, and vice versa: first a DBN is\\ntrained (without supervision) to learn features in images, and another DBN is trained\\n(again without supervision) to learn features in sets of captions (e.g., “car” often\\ncomes with “automobile”). Then an RBM is stacked on top of both DBNs and trained\\nwith a set of images along with their captions; it learns to associate high-level features\\nin images with high-level features in captions. Next, if you feed the image DBN an\\nimage of a car, the signal will propagate through the network, up to the top-level\\nRBM, and back down to the bottom of the caption DBN, producing a caption. Due to\\nthe stochastic nature of RBMs and DBNs, the caption will keep changing randomly,\\nbut it will generally be appropriate for the image. If you generate a few hundred cap‐\\ntions, the most frequently generated ones will likely be a good description of the\\nimage.3\\nSelf-Organizing Maps\\nSelf-organizing maps (SOM) are quite different from all the other types of neural net‐\\nworks we have discussed so far.

A former Googler, he led the Y ou‐\\nTube video classification team from 2013 to 2016. He was also a founder and CTO of\\nWifirst from 2002 to 2012, a leading Wireless ISP in France; and a founder and CTO\\nof Polyconseil in 2001, the firm that now manages the electric car sharing service\\nAutolib’ .\\nBefore this he worked as an engineer in a variety of domains: finance (JP Morgan and\\nSociété Générale), defense (Canada’s DOD), and healthcare (blood transfusion). He\\npublished a few technical books (on C++, WiFi, and internet architectures), and was\\na Computer Science lecturer in a French engineering school.\\nA few fun facts: he taught his three children to count in binary with their fingers (up\\nto 1023), he studied microbiology and evolutionary genetics before going into soft‐\\nware engineering, and his parachute didn’t open on the second jump.\\nColophon\\nThe animal on the cover of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Ten‐\\nsorFlow is the far eastern fire salamander (Salamandra infraimmaculata), an amphib‐\\nian found in the Middle East. They have black skin featuring large yellow spots on\\ntheir back and head. These spots are a warning coloration meant to keep predators at\\nbay. Full-grown salamanders can be over a foot in length.\\nFar eastern fire salamanders live in subtropical shrubland and forests near rivers or\\nother freshwater bodies. They spend most of their life on land, but lay their eggs in\\nthe water. They subsist mostly on a diet of insects, worms, and small crustaceans, but\\noccasionally eat other salamanders. Males of the species have been known to live up\\nto 23 years, while females can live up to 21 years.\\nAlthough not yet endangered, the far eastern fire salamander population is in decline.\\nPrimary threats include damming of rivers (which disrupts the salamander’s breed‐\\ning) and pollution. They are also threatened by the recent introduction of predatory\\nfish, such as the mosquitofish. These fish were intended to control the mosquito pop‐\\nulation, but they also feed on young salamanders.\\nMany of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to\\nthe world. To learn more about how you can help, go to animals.oreilly.com.\\nThe cover image is from Wood’s Illustrated Natural History. The cover fonts are URW\\nTypewriter and Guardian Sans. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font\\nis Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.\\n\\x00D\\x00o\\x00w\\x00n\\x00l\\x00o\\x00a\\x00d\\x00 \\x00f\\x00r\\x00o\\x00m\\x00 \\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00 \\x00w\\x00w\\x00w\\x00.\\x00f\\x00i\\x00n\\x00e\\x00l\\x00y\\x00b\\x00o\\x00o\\x00k\\x00.\\x00c\\x00o\\x00m')]"
